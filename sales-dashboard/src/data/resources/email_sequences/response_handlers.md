## Positive Response Handlers

### "Tell me more" / "This looks interesting"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

Great to hear from you!

Quick overview: We do a one-day, on-site AI workshop
for brokerages. Your agents leave with:

- Working prompts for listings, emails, and social
- A personalized "Voice Card" so AI sounds like them
- Fraud detection training (critical right now)

The result: 5-10 hours/week back per agent.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it's a fit?
I have time [Day] at [Time] or [Day] at [Time].

Perfect—let's do it.

I have:
- [Day], [Time]
- [Day], [Time]

Which works better? I'll send a calendar invite
with a quick agenda.

Talk soon,

**Action:** Send calendar invite immediately after they confirm.

## Soft Objection Handlers

### "Not right now" / "Maybe later"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

Totally understand—timing is everything.

Quick question: When would be a better time?
Happy to follow up in [Q1 / January / after the holidays].

Just let me know and I'll put it on my calendar.

[Your Name]
```

**Action:** Set follow-up reminder for their suggested timing.

### "Check back in [specific time]"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

Will do. I'll reach out in [time period].

In the meantime, if anything changes or you have questions,
I'm at [Your Phone].

Talk then,
[Your Name]
```

**Action:** Set calendar reminder, send follow-up on that date.

### "We're too busy right now"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

I hear you—this time of year is crazy.

Here's the flip side: we typically schedule 4-6 weeks out.
By then, things usually calm down.

Would it make sense to pencil in a date now?
That way it's on the calendar and you don't have to
think about it again until we get closer.

Let me know,
[Your Name]
```

## Hard Objection Handlers

### "Not interested"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

Got it—thanks for letting me know.

Quick question before I close your file:
Is it the timing, the concept, or something else?

Either way, I appreciate the response.

[Your Name]
```

**If they respond with a reason:** Note it, don't argue.
**Action:** Mark as "Not Interested" in CRM, send referral ask email in 1 week.

### "Remove me from your list"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

Done. You won't hear from me again.

Thanks for your time,
[Your Name]
```

**Action:** Mark as "Unsubscribe" in CRM. DO NOT CONTACT AGAIN.

### "We already have AI training" / "Already working with someone"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

Good to hear—you're ahead of most.

Out of curiosity, who are you working with?
Always good to know who else is in the space.

Either way, best of luck with it.

[Your Name]
```

**If they respond:** Note competitor, file for reference.
**Action:** Mark as "Competitor" in CRM, check back in 6 months.

### "Too expensive"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

I get it—$5,000 is an investment.

Quick thought: For a 10-agent team, that's $500/agent.
If AI saves each agent even 4 hours/week,
you're looking at $60K/year in recovered productivity.

Would a 3-hour version at $3,000 be more realistic?
Same core skills, half the time.

Let me know,
[Your Name]
```

## Question Handlers

### "What does this cost?"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

Good question.

- 6-Hour Masterclass: $5,000 (full day, complete curriculum)
- 3-Hour Workshop: $3,000 (core skills, half day)

For a 10-agent team, the full day is $500/agent.
Most teams see 12:1 ROI in year one.

Worth a quick call to see which option makes sense?

[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
```

### "How long is the training?"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

We have two options:

- 6-Hour Masterclass: Full day, 9am-4pm with lunch
  (Complete curriculum, all exercises, fraud training)

- 3-Hour Workshop: Half day, ~11am-2pm
  (Core skills, key prompts, streamlined exercises)

Both are on-site at your office.

Which format works better for your team?

[Your Name]
```

### "Do you offer CE credits?"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

The curriculum can be CE-eligible depending on your state.
We've worked with associations to get approval.

What state are you in? I can check the requirements
and let you know the process.

[Your Name]
```

### "What makes you different?"

**Response Template:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject]

[First Name],

Fair question. Here's what sets us apart:

1. **Real estate specific** - Not generic AI training.
   Prompts for listings, follow-up, social. Plus fraud
   detection and Fair Housing guardrails.

2. **Hands-on implementation** - Your agents BUILD during
   the workshop. They leave with working systems,
   not just concepts.

3. **On-site delivery** - We come to you. Questions get
   answered live. No webinar fatigue.

Would a quick call help me understand what you're
comparing against?

[Your Phone]
