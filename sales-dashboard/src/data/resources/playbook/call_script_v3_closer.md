# Call Script v3 (CLOSER Framework)

Based on Alex Hormozi's sales methodology. Outcome-focused, conviction-driven, data-backed.

## The CLOSER Framework

```
C - CLARIFY     → Deep discovery questions
L - LABEL       → Name the problem
O - OVERVIEW    → Explore past failures
S - SELL VACATION → Paint outcomes, not features
E - EXPLAIN     → Preempt concerns
R - REINFORCE   → Make them close themselves
```

## Core Principles

1. **"Sell the vacation, not the plane ride"** - Focus on what changes, not what you deliver
2. **10% words, 90% tonality** - Conviction matters more than script
3. **Only 3 things on calls:** Questions, Restatements, Anecdotal stories
4. **Discovery over pitching** - Listen 60%, talk 40%

---

## Stage 1: CLARIFY (60 seconds)

**Goal:** Understand their world before proposing anything.

### Opening (use personalized hook)
```
"Hey [First Name], [read personalized hook from CRM].
Quick question for you—

When you think about your agents' productivity,
what's the one thing eating up most of their time right now?"
```

### Discovery Prompts (pick 2-3)
- "Walk me through what happens when an agent gets a new listing."
- "How long does that typically take them?"
- "What have you tried to speed that up?"
- "How many agents do you have on your team?"
- "What's your biggest bottleneck—marketing, operations, or productivity?"

### What You're Listening For
- Hours lost per agent per week
- Specific pain points (listings, follow-ups, admin)
- Team size (for ROI math)
- Current tools or attempts

---

## Stage 2: LABEL (30 seconds)

**Goal:** Name their problem so they feel understood.

### The Restatement
```
"So if I'm hearing you right, your agents are spending
[X hours] on [specific task] that should take [Y minutes].

That's [X × agents × 52] hours a year going to admin instead of deals.
That's the bottleneck, right?"
```

### The Math Card
| Hours/Week | Agents | Annual Hours Lost |
|------------|--------|-------------------|
| 5 | 10 | 2,600 hours |
| 5 | 20 | 5,200 hours |
| 10 | 20 | 10,400 hours |
| 10 | 50 | 26,000 hours |

### Why This Works
When you name their problem accurately, they feel understood.
When you quantify it, they feel the weight of doing nothing.

---

## Stage 3: OVERVIEW (30 seconds)

**Goal:** Understand why previous solutions failed.

### The Question
```
"What have you tried before?

Most brokerages I talk to have either:
- Done nothing and hoped it would figure itself out
- Tried ChatGPT and got garbage output
- Bought software that no one actually uses

Where do you fall?"
```

### Why This Works
- Shows you understand the landscape
- Positions you as someone who's seen it all
- Lets you tailor your pitch to their specific failure mode

### Common Responses & Follow-ups
| Response | Follow-up |
|----------|-----------|
| "Nothing" | "What's held you back?" |
| "Tried ChatGPT" | "What went wrong?" |
| "Bought software" | "What didn't stick?" |
| "Had training" | "What didn't translate to action?" |

---

## Stage 4: SELL THE VACATION (60 seconds)

**Goal:** Paint the outcome, not the process.

### DON'T Say This (Feature-Focused)
```
"We do a 6-hour workshop where we cover prompts,
templates, voice cards, fraud detection, and..."
```

### DO Say This (Outcome-Focused)
```
"Imagine it's Monday after the workshop.

Your agents open their laptops, type 3 sentences about a listing,
and get back a description that used to take 45 minutes.
They copy-paste it into MLS and move on.

That's the 5-hour-a-week savings. Every week. Forever.

The workshop is one day. The results are permanent."
```

### Vacation Statements by Pain

| Their Pain | Your Vacation Statement |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Time on listings | "45 minutes → 5 minutes. Every listing." |
| Follow-up chaos | "Never forget a follow-up again." |
| New agent ramp | "New agents producing like veterans in week one." |
| Tech overwhelm | "One system that does 10 things." |
| Agent adoption | "They build it themselves, so they actually use it." |
| Training that doesn't stick | "They leave with working systems, not notes." |

### The Key Insight
People don't buy a drill. They buy a hole in the wall.
People don't buy a workshop. They buy agents who save 5 hours a week.

---

## Stage 5: EXPLAIN (45 seconds)

**Goal:** Address concerns before they become objections.

### The Pre-Frame
```
"Now, you're probably thinking one of three things:

1. 'My agents won't actually use it.'
   — They will, because they build it themselves.

2. 'We've tried training before and it didn't stick.'
   — This isn't a webinar. They leave with working systems.

3. 'Is this worth $5K?'
   — If 10 agents save 5 hours a week, that's $60K in productivity year one.
   That's 12:1 ROI.

Which one were you thinking?"
```

### Pre-Framed Objection Cards

| Objection | Pre-Frame Response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Too expensive" | "Most people think $5K is high until they do the math. 10 agents × 5 hours × $50/hour × 52 weeks = $130K in recovered time. The workshop is 4% of that." |
| "Agents won't use it" | "Every brokerage worries about adoption. That's why they build it live. If you build it, you use it." |
| "Already using AI" | "Using vs. using well are different. Most agents tried ChatGPT once, got garbage, and quit. We turn the toy into a teammate." |
| "Need to think" | "Totally fair. What specifically would help you decide?" |
| "Send me info" | "Happy to. Quick question—are you open to on-site training if the curriculum fits? I don't want to waste your time with a PDF if this isn't a fit." |
| "Bad timing" | "I hear you. When would be better to revisit this? [Set specific follow-up]" |

---

## Stage 6: REINFORCE (30 seconds)

**Goal:** Make them close themselves.

### The Tie-Back
```
"Based on what you told me—[restate their pain],
this would give you [restate vacation].

Does that sound like something worth exploring on a 15-minute call?"
```

### If Yes
```
"Great. I've got [Day 1] or [Day 2]—which works better?"
```

### If Hesitant
```
"Tell you what—can I send you the curriculum?
If it makes sense after you review it, we'll find 15 minutes."
```

### If No
```
"No problem. Quick question before I let you go—
do you know any other brokerages in [City] who might benefit?
I'm offering $250 for any intro that books a call."
```

---

## Quick Reference: Data Cards

### ROI Math
```
5 hours/week saved × $50/hour = $250/agent/month
$250 × 12 months = $3,000/agent/year

Team of 10 agents: $30,000/year value
Team of 20 agents: $60,000/year value
Team of 50 agents: $150,000/year value

Workshop cost: $5,000
First-year ROI: 6:1 to 30:1
```

### Time Savings Examples
| Task | Before | After | Savings |
|------|--------|-------|---------|
| Listing description | 45 min | 5 min | 40 min |
| Follow-up email | 15 min | 2 min | 13 min |
| Social media post | 20 min | 3 min | 17 min |
| Market report | 60 min | 10 min | 50 min |
| Open house invite | 30 min | 5 min | 25 min |

### Credibility Anchors
- "We've trained 50+ brokerages in the region."
- "Average agent saves 5-10 hours per week."
- "97% say they'd recommend to another brokerage."

## Tonality Guidelines (The 90%)

### Conviction > Script
- Say less, mean more
- Pause after questions (let silence work)
- Match their energy, don't overpower
- Sound like you're having coffee, not reading

### What Conviction Sounds Like
- "I know this works because I've seen it work."
- "The math is simple. It either makes sense or it doesn't."
- "I'm not here to convince you. I'm here to see if it fits."

### Red Flags You're Pitching Too Hard
- Talking more than 40% of the call
- Answering questions they didn't ask
- Defending instead of clarifying
- Rushing to the close
- Saying "um" or "like" repeatedly

## Mindset

You're not selling. You're **helping them discover** if this is a fit.
If it's not, thank them and move on.
Not every lead is a customer—and that's okay.

The best salespeople are the ones who believe in what they sell.
If you don't believe AI can save these agents 5+ hours a week,
you shouldn't be on this call.
