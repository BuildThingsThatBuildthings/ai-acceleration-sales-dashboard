# Daily Workflow

## Morning Prep (8:00-8:30 AM)

### 8:00 AM - Setup
- [ ] Open Google Sheet (leads tab)
- [ ] Open Instantly (check email opens/replies)
- [ ] Open this playbook (objections folder ready)
- [ ] Coffee/water at desk
- [ ] Phone charged, headset ready

### 8:15 AM - Pull Today's List
1. Filter sheet by Status = "Lead" (uncontacted)
2. Select 25 leads for morning block
3. Prioritize:
   - Email openers (from Instantly) → CALL FIRST
   - Recent adds (fresher data)
   - Larger brokerages (higher value)

### 8:25 AM - Mental Prep
- Read 3 AI Opening Hooks out loud (warm up your voice)
- Review yesterday's best call (what worked?)
- Set intention: "I'm helping them, not selling them"

---

## Call Block 1 (9:00-11:00 AM)

### The Rhythm
- **Call → Log → Next** (don't stop to think)
- Update status IMMEDIATELY after each call
- Leave voicemails (see voicemail scripts)
- Target: 20 dials in 2 hours

### For Each Call
1. **Before dialing**: Read the AI Opening Hook once
2. **Opening**: Use the word-for-word script
3. **If connected**: Run through 8 stages
4. **After call**: Update sheet immediately
   - Status (Contacted/Booked/Not Interested/Bad Data)
   - Call Notes (what they said, objections)
   - Follow Up Date (if applicable)

### Voicemail Script (30 seconds max)
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.
I'm reaching out because [one sentence from AI Opening Hook].
I help brokerages get their agents using AI in ways that actually
save time. Worth a quick call? I'm at [Your Number]. Thanks!"
```

## Midday Break (11:00-11:30 AM)

### 11:00 AM - Hot Lead Review
1. Open Instantly dashboard
2. Check who opened emails (these are warm)
3. Check who replied (these are HOT)
4. Move hot leads to top of afternoon list

### 11:15 AM - Data Cleanup
- Any bad numbers? Flag for research
- Any wrong contacts? Note who they referred
- Any patterns? (e.g., "CFO handles this, not broker")

### 11:25 AM - Break
- Step away from desk
- Quick walk
- Clear your head for afternoon

---

## Lunch (11:30 AM-12:30 PM)

Eat. Recharge. Don't work through lunch—you need energy for afternoon calls.

---

## Call Block 2 (1:00-3:00 PM)

### Priority Order
1. **Email repliers** (highest intent)
2. **Email openers** (showed interest)
3. **Callback requests** (from morning)
4. **Fresh leads** (if time permits)

### Afternoon Mindset
- Afternoon connects are often better (decision makers have cleared morning)
- Be slightly more direct (people are busy)
- If someone's short, ask: "Is there a better time to catch you?"

### Target: 20 more dials

---

## Tips for Max Productivity

### Do
- Stand while calling (more energy in your voice)
- Smile while talking (they can hear it)
- Take notes in real-time (don't rely on memory)
- Move fast between calls (momentum matters)

### Don't
- Check email between calls (breaks flow)
- Research during call blocks (do it before/after)
- Get stuck on one lead (flag and move on)
- Take rejection personally (it's a numbers game)

---

## When Things Go Sideways

### "I'm having a bad morning"
- Take a 5-minute walk
- Call an easy lead (someone who was warm before)
- Remember: one good conversation resets everything

### "No one's answering"
- Normal. 60-70% go to voicemail.
- Leave good voicemails—they call back
- Afternoon often has better connect rates

### "I keep getting objections"
- Review objections folder
- Write down the exact objection
- Practice the reframe out loud
- Ask for help if needed

### "The data is bad"
- Flag in sheet, move to next
- Don't waste time fixing data during call blocks
- Batch data cleanup for end of day
