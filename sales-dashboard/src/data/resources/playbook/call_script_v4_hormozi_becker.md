# Call Script v4: Hormozi CLOSER + Becker High-Ticket Framework

The definitive cold call script combining Alex Hormozi's CLOSER framework with Alex Becker's high-ticket consulting positioning. Conviction-driven, value-stacked, outcome-obsessed.

---

## The Hybrid Framework: C.L.O.S.E.R. + H.T.C.

```
C - CLARIFY      → Deep discovery (understand their world)
L - LABEL        → Name + quantify their problem
O - OVERVIEW     → Explore past failures (why nothing worked)
S - SELL VACATION → Paint outcomes, not features
E - EXPLAIN      → Preempt top 3 concerns
R - REINFORCE    → Make them close themselves

H.T.C. Layer (Becker's High-Ticket Consulting):
H - HIGH-VALUE POSITIONING → You solve expensive problems
T - TIMELINE URGENCY       → AI is moving fast, waiting costs
C - CONSULTANT, NOT SELLER → You're qualifying THEM
```

---

## Core Principles (Memorize These)

### Hormozi's Laws
1. **"Sell the vacation, not the plane ride"** - Focus on Monday morning, not the workshop
2. **10% words, 90% tonality** - Conviction > script perfection
3. **Only 3 things on calls:** Questions, Restatements, Anecdotal stories
4. **Discovery over pitching** - Listen 60%, talk 40%

### Becker's Laws
1. **You're the prize** - You're selecting clients, not begging for them
2. **Expensive problems = expensive solutions** - Never apologize for price
3. **Fear of missing out beats fear of spending** - Timeline urgency
4. **Consultant positioning** - You're diagnosing, not selling

### The Conviction Rule
> "If you don't believe AI can save these agents 5+ hours a week, you shouldn't be on this call."

---

## Pre-Call Setup (30 Seconds)

Before EVERY call:

### 1. Prime Your Conviction
Say out loud: *"I have something valuable. I'm here to see if they qualify."*

### 2. Read the Hook
Find "AI Opening Hook" in CRM. Read it once out loud.

### 3. Say Their Name
"[First Name], [First Name], [First Name]" - prevents blanking

### 4. Deep Breath
You're helping them. They need this. Dial.

---

## STAGE 1: CLARIFY (60 seconds)

**Goal:** Understand their world before proposing anything.

### The Opening (Hormozi Pattern Interrupt + Becker Positioning)

```
"Hey [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.

[Read personalized hook from CRM—specific, not generic]

I work with brokerages that want their agents to stop drowning in admin
and start closing more deals. Quick question—

When you think about your agents' productivity,
what's the ONE thing eating up most of their time?"
```

### Why This Works
- **Pattern interrupt**: The personalized hook shows you did research
- **Becker positioning**: "I work with brokerages that want..." (selective, not desperate)
- **Open-ended question**: Gets them talking (you learn, they invest)

### Discovery Prompts (Pick 2-3 max)

| Question | What You're Learning |
|----------|---------------------|
| "Walk me through what happens when an agent gets a new listing." | Their current process (pain lives here) |
| "How long does that typically take?" | Hours lost = ROI math fuel |
| "What have you tried to speed that up?" | Past failures to reference later |
| "How many agents on your team?" | ROI multiplier |
| "What's your biggest bottleneck—marketing, operations, or productivity?" | Where to focus vacation statement |

### What You're Listening For
- [ ] Hours lost per agent per week
- [ ] Specific pain points (listings, follow-ups, admin, social)
- [ ] Team size (critical for ROI math)
- [ ] Current tools or attempts (what failed)

### Red Flags (Disqualify Early)
- Solo agent (no leverage) → "This is designed for teams. Best of luck."
- No decision-making authority → "Who else would need to weigh in?"
- No budget awareness → "Just so I don't waste your time—this is $5K. Is that something you'd consider?"

---

## STAGE 2: LABEL (30 seconds)

**Goal:** Name their problem so they feel understood. Quantify it so they feel the weight.

### The Restatement

```
"So if I'm hearing you right, your agents are spending
[X hours] on [specific task] that should take [Y minutes].

That's [X × agents × 52] hours a year going to admin instead of deals.

For a team your size, that's roughly [$X] in lost productivity.

That's the bottleneck, right?"
```

### The Math Card (Have Ready)

| Hours/Week | Agents | Annual Hours Lost | Dollar Value ($50/hr) |
|------------|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 5 | 10 | 2,600 hours | $130,000 |
| 5 | 20 | 5,200 hours | $260,000 |
| 10 | 10 | 5,200 hours | $260,000 |
| 10 | 20 | 10,400 hours | $520,000 |
| 10 | 50 | 26,000 hours | $1,300,000 |

### Why This Works (Becker's "Expensive Problem" Positioning)
- When you name their problem accurately, they feel understood
- When you quantify it in DOLLARS, they feel the weight of doing nothing
- A $130K problem makes a $5K solution feel small

### Pause After the Question
Let them confirm. Silence = agreement. Don't fill the space.

---

## STAGE 3: OVERVIEW (30 seconds)

**Goal:** Understand why previous solutions failed. Position yourself as different.

### The Question

```
"What have you tried before?

Most brokerages I talk to fall into one of three buckets:
- Did nothing and hoped it would figure itself out
- Tried ChatGPT and got garbage output
- Bought software or training that no one actually uses

Where do you fall?"
```

### Follow-Up by Response

| Their Response | Your Follow-Up |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Nothing" | "What's held you back? Time? Priority? Not sure where to start?" |
| "Tried ChatGPT" | "What went wrong? Garbage output? Agents didn't stick with it?" |
| "Bought software" | "What didn't stick? Was it too complicated, or just not relevant?" |
| "Had training" | "What didn't translate to action? Theory without practice?" |

### Why This Works
- Shows you've heard it all (credibility)
- Lets you tailor your pitch to their specific failure
- Creates contrast: "We're different because..."

### The Failure Pivot (Becker-Style)

```
"Got it. So [their failure mode] didn't work because [reason].

Here's what's different about what we do..."
```

---

## STAGE 4: SELL THE VACATION (60 seconds)

**Goal:** Paint the OUTCOME, not the process. Make them see Monday morning.

### DON'T Say This (Feature-Dump)

```
"We do a 6-hour workshop where we cover prompts, templates,
voice cards, fraud detection, listing descriptions, social media..."
```

**Why it fails:** Features = boring. They don't care HOW, they care WHAT CHANGES.

### DO Say This (Outcome-Obsessed)

```
"Imagine it's Monday after the workshop.

Your agents open their laptops, type 3 sentences about a listing,
and get back a description that used to take 45 minutes.
They copy-paste it into MLS and move on.

That's the 5-hour-a-week savings. Every week. Forever.

The workshop is one day. The results are permanent."
```

### Vacation Statements by Pain

| Their Pain | Your Vacation Statement |
|------------|------------------------|
| Time on listings | "45 minutes → 5 minutes. Every listing. Forever." |
| Follow-up chaos | "Never forget a follow-up again. The system tracks it for them." |
| New agent ramp | "New agents producing like veterans in week one." |
| Tech overwhelm | "One system that does 10 things. No more app-switching chaos." |
| Agent adoption | "They build it themselves, so they actually use it." |
| Training that doesn't stick | "They leave with working systems, not notes they'll never open." |
| Competitive pressure | "Your agents outpace the competition because they have tools others don't." |
| Admin burnout | "5-10 hours back every week. That's a whole extra day." |

### Becker's "Timeline Urgency" Layer

```
"And here's the thing—AI is moving fast.
Six months from now, this is table stakes.
The brokerages training their agents NOW will have a head start.
The ones waiting will be playing catch-up."
```

### The Key Insight
> People don't buy a drill. They buy a hole in the wall.
> People don't buy a workshop. They buy agents who save 5 hours a week.

---

## STAGE 5: EXPLAIN (45 seconds)

**Goal:** Address concerns BEFORE they become objections. Pre-frame = control the narrative.

### The Pre-Frame

```
"Now, you're probably thinking one of three things:

1. 'My agents won't actually use it.'
   — They will, because they build it themselves. Hands-on, not lecture.

2. 'We've tried training before and it didn't stick.'
   — This isn't a webinar. They leave with working systems in their phones.

3. 'Is this worth $5K?'
   — If 10 agents save 5 hours a week, that's $130K in productivity year one.
   The workshop is 4% of that. It pays for itself in month one.

Which one were you thinking?"
```

### Why This Works
- Acknowledges their skepticism (they feel heard)
- Answers before they ask (you control the frame)
- Ends with a question (surfaces the REAL objection)

### Pre-Frame Cards (Top 8 Objections)

| Objection | Pre-Frame + Full Response |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **"Too expensive"** | "Most people think $5K is high until they do the math. 10 agents × 5 hours × $50/hour × 52 weeks = $130K in recovered time. The workshop is 4% of that. It pays for itself in month one." |
| **"Agents won't use it"** | "Every brokerage worries about adoption. That's why they build it live. If you build it, you use it. They don't leave with notes—they leave with working systems." |
| **"Already using AI"** | "Using vs. using WELL are different. Most agents tried ChatGPT once, got garbage, and quit. We turn the toy into a teammate. What tools are they using now?" |
| **"Need to think about it"** | "Totally fair. What specifically would help you decide? Is it the price, the timing, or something about how it works?" |
| **"Send me info"** | "Happy to. Quick question—are you open to on-site training if the curriculum fits? I don't want to waste your time with a PDF if this isn't a fit." |
| **"Bad timing"** | "I hear you. When would be better? Q1? Q2? I can set a reminder and follow up then." |
| **"Already had training"** | "What didn't translate to action? Most training doesn't stick because it's theory, not practice. Our agents build working systems live. They use them Monday morning." |
| **"Agents are too old/resistant"** | "We've trained agents in their 60s who'd never opened ChatGPT. They leave confident. If they can copy-paste, they can use this." |

### The EIR Framework (For Objections That Arise)

```
E - EMPATHIZE    "I hear you..." (don't argue)
I - ISOLATE      "Is it the timing or the investment?" (find the real issue)
R - REFRAME      "Here's another way to look at it..." (new perspective)
```

---

## STAGE 6: REINFORCE (30 seconds)

**Goal:** Make them close THEMSELVES. Tie their pain to your vacation.

### The Tie-Back

```
"Based on what you told me—[restate their pain in their words],
this would give you [restate vacation].

Does that sound like something worth 15 minutes to explore?"
```

### The Becker "Consultant Close"

Notice: You're not begging. You're asking if THEY qualify.

```
"Based on what you've shared, I think you'd be a good fit for this.
The question is whether the timing works on your end.
I've got [Day 1] or [Day 2]—which works better for a quick call?"
```

### Response Handling

| Their Response | Your Move |
|----------------|-----------|
| **YES** | "Great. I've got [Day 1] or [Day 2]—which works better?" (give two options) |
| **HESITANT** | "Tell you what—can I send you the curriculum? If it makes sense, we'll find 15 minutes." |
| **NO** | "No problem. Quick question—do you know any other brokerages in [City] who might benefit? I'm offering $250 for any intro that books a call." |

### After YES: Lock It Down

```
"Perfect. I'll send you a calendar invite right now.
What email should I use?"

[Get email, send invite IMMEDIATELY while on the call]

"Done. You should have it. See you [Day]."
```

---

## Quick Reference: Data Cards

### ROI Math (Memorize This)

```
5 hours/week × $50/hour = $250/agent/month
$250 × 12 months = $3,000/agent/year

Team of 10 agents: $30,000/year value
Team of 20 agents: $60,000/year value
Team of 50 agents: $150,000/year value

Workshop cost: $5,000
First-year ROI: 6:1 to 30:1
Payback: Month 1
```

### Time Savings Examples

| Task | Before AI | After AI | Time Saved |
|------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Listing description | 45 min | 5 min | 40 min |
| Follow-up email | 15 min | 2 min | 13 min |
| Social media post | 20 min | 3 min | 17 min |
| Market report | 60 min | 10 min | 50 min |
| Open house invite | 30 min | 5 min | 25 min |
| Newsletter content | 90 min | 15 min | 75 min |
| Property flyer | 30 min | 5 min | 25 min |
| Buyer follow-up sequence | 60 min | 10 min | 50 min |

### Credibility Anchors

- "We've trained 50+ brokerages in the region."
- "Average agent saves 5-10 hours per week."
- "97% say they'd recommend to another brokerage."
- "Agents who complete the workshop use AI daily."
- "ROI is typically 6:1 in year one."

## Tonality Guidelines (The 90%)

### Conviction > Script

The words are 10%. How you say them is 90%.

| Bad Tonality | Good Tonality |
|--------------|---------------|
| Rushed, desperate | Calm, confident |
| Reading from a script | Having a conversation |
| Higher pitch (nervous) | Lower pitch (authority) |
| Filling silence | Letting silence work |
| Defensive when challenged | Curious when challenged |

### What Conviction Sounds Like

- "I know this works because I've seen it work."
- "The math is simple. It either makes sense or it doesn't."
- "I'm not here to convince you. I'm here to see if it fits."
- "If this doesn't help your agents, I want to know why."
- "The workshop is one day. The results are permanent."

### Red Flags (You're Pitching Too Hard)

- [ ] Talking more than 40% of the call
- [ ] Answering questions they didn't ask
- [ ] Defending instead of clarifying
- [ ] Rushing to the close
- [ ] Saying "um," "like," "you know" repeatedly
- [ ] Voice pitch going up (nervousness)

---

## The Becker Mindset Shift

### Old Frame (Seller)
- "I need to convince them to buy"
- "The price is high, I need to justify it"
- "Every lead is a potential customer"
- "I hope they say yes"

### New Frame (Consultant)
- "I'm here to see if they qualify"
- "The price is fair for the value—I don't apologize"
- "Not every lead is a fit—and that's fine"
- "I'm helping them make the right decision either way"

### The Truth
> You're not selling. You're helping them discover if this is a fit.
> If it's not, thank them and move on.
> The best salespeople are the ones who believe in what they sell.

---

## Daily Affirmations (Read Before Call Block)

1. I have something valuable. I'm here to see if they qualify.
2. The math is simple. It either makes sense or it doesn't.
3. Every "no" gets me closer to "yes."
4. I'm helping, not selling.
5. Conviction corrects tonality.
6. The workshop is one day. The results are permanent.
7. I've done this before. I'll do it again. Just dial.
