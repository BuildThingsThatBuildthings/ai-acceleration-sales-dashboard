# First Call Training (For Newer Reps)

## The Truth About Cold Calling

Before your first dial, understand this:
- **60-70% of calls go to voicemail.** That's normal.
- **Most conversations end in "not interested."** That's normal too.
- **You will stumble.** Everyone does. It gets easier.

Your job in Week 1 is NOT to book demos.
Your job is to **get comfortable talking to strangers.**

## Pre-Call Ritual (Do This Before EVERY Call)

### 1. Read the Hook Out Loud
Open the lead's row. Find "AI Opening Hook."
Read it out loud once. This is your pattern interrupt.

### 2. Say Their Name 3 Times
"[First Name], [First Name], [First Name]"
This prevents you from blanking when they answer.

### 3. Deep Breath
You're helping them, not selling them.
They need this training. You're doing them a favor.

### 4. Dial
Don't overthink. Just dial.

## Word-for-Word Opening (No Improvisation Needed)

You don't need to be creative. Just read these words:

### When They Answer
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.
I sent you an email about [read AI Subject Line].
Did you have a chance to look at it?"
```

### If They Say "YES, I saw it"
```
"Great—what stood out to you?"
```
*Then listen. Let them talk.*

### If They Say "NO, I didn't see it"
```
"No worries. Quick version: We do one-day AI workshops
for brokerages. Agents leave with systems they use
Monday morning. Worth 2 minutes to explain?"
```

### If They Say "WHO is this?"
```
"This is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.
I'm reaching out because [read AI Opening Hook].
Is now a bad time?"
```

## The Three "No"s You'll Hear Most

### "I'm busy right now"

This is NOT a rejection. They're just busy.

**Say this:**
```
"Totally understand—when's a better time to call back?
I'll put 15 minutes on your calendar and send the
curriculum ahead of time."
```

**Then:** Set the follow-up date in the sheet and move on.

---

### "We're not interested"

This IS a soft rejection. But you can still learn.

**Say this:**
```
"Got it. Mind if I ask—is it the concept of AI training,
or just bad timing?"
```

*Listen to their answer. Note it in the sheet.*

**Then:**
```
"Understood. Thanks for your time, [First Name]."
```

Move on. Don't argue.

---

### "How did you get my number?"

This is suspicion, not rejection.

**Say this:**
```
"Public info from your website. I'm reaching out because
[reference AI Opening Hook]—thought it was worth a conversation.
Should I take you off the list?"
```

Most will say "No, that's fine, what is this about?"
Now you have permission to pitch.

## Voicemail Script (When You Get VM)

Most calls go to voicemail. Leave a good one.

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.
I'm reaching out because [one sentence from AI Opening Hook].
I help brokerages get their agents using AI in ways
that actually save time. Worth a quick call?
I'm at [Your Number]. Thanks!"
```

**Keep it under 30 seconds.**
**Say your number slowly.**
**Sound like a human, not a robot.**

training for brokerages do you have time to talk?"

Prospect: "No thanks." *click*
```

### Good Call (Confident, Human)
```
Caller: "Hi Sarah, this is John with AI Acceleration.
I sent you an email about the record year at
Berkshire Hathaway Louisville. Did you have a
chance to look at it?"

Prospect: "No, I haven't. What's this about?"

Caller: "No worries. Quick version—we do one-day
AI workshops for brokerages. Agents leave with
prompts and systems they use Monday morning.
Worth 2 minutes?"

Prospect: "Sure, go ahead."

[Conversation continues...]
```
