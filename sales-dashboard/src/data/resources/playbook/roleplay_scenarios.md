## PART 1: OPENING SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: The Warm Pickup
**Setup:** Sarah at Keller Williams Louisville. Just had a record quarter.

**Prospect says:** "This is Sarah."

**Practice:** Deliver your pattern interrupt + permission ask.

**Good response:**
```
"Hey Sarah, this is [Name] with AI Acceleration.
I saw Keller Williams Louisville had a record quarter—congrats on that.
I work with brokerages getting their agents to use AI in ways that actually save time.
Mind if I ask one quick question?"
```

**Grade yourself:**

**Practice:** Get to the decision maker without being screened out.

**Good response:**
```
"Hi, I'm trying to reach [First Name from CRM].
This is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.
Is [he/she] available?"
```

**If they ask "What's this regarding?":**
```
"I sent [him/her] some information about AI training for the team.
Just following up. Is now a good time or should I try back?"
```

**Good response:**
```
"This is [Name] with AI Acceleration.
Your info is public from your website—I'm reaching out because
[read personalized hook].
Should I take you off the list, or is this a good time for a quick question?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Answered directly (didn't dodge)
- [ ] Gave them an out (reduces defensiveness)
- [ ] Pivoted to hook (pattern interrupt)

---

### Scenario 4: The Rushed Pickup
**Setup:** They answer but sound busy/distracted.

**Prospect says:** "Yeah? What is it?"

**Practice:** Match energy, be brief, hook fast.

**Good response:**
```
"Hey [First Name], caught you at a busy time.
Quick version: I help brokerages get agents using AI that saves 5+ hours a week.
Worth 60 seconds to see if it's relevant, or should I call back?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Acknowledged their state
- [ ] Got to value prop in <10 seconds
- [ ] Offered an exit (counterintuitively keeps them)

---

### Scenario 5: The Voicemail
**Setup:** Call goes to voicemail. Leave a message that gets callbacks.

**Practice:** Leave a <30 second voicemail.

**Good response:**
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.
I'm reaching out because [one sentence from personalized hook].
I help brokerages get agents using AI in ways that actually save time.
Worth a quick call? I'm at [number, slowly].
Thanks!"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Under 30 seconds
- [ ] Said phone number slowly
- [ ] Sounded like a human, not a robot
- [ ] Used personalized hook (not generic)

---

## PART 2: DISCOVERY SCENARIOS

### Scenario 6: The Chatty Prospect
**Setup:** They want to talk about everything EXCEPT their problems.

**Prospect says:** "Oh, AI is so interesting! My nephew showed me ChatGPT the other day. Have you tried Gemini? What about..."

**Practice:** Redirect to discovery without being rude.

**Good response:**
```
"That's great you're exploring! Quick question though—
when your agents are using AI, what's actually working for them?
What's NOT working?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Acknowledged their interest
- [ ] Redirected with a question
- [ ] Kept focus on THEIR situation

---

### Scenario 7: The Vague Answerer
**Setup:** They give non-specific answers.

**You ask:** "What's eating up your agents' time?"
**Prospect says:** "Oh, you know, the usual stuff."

**Practice:** Get specific information.

**Good response:**
```
"Got it. Let me give you some examples I hear from other brokerages—
listing descriptions, follow-up emails, social media, market reports.
Which of those is the biggest time-suck for your team?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Offered specific options
- [ ] Let them pick (feels easier than open-ended)
- [ ] Kept control of conversation

---

### Scenario 8: The Numbers Avoider
**Setup:** You need team size for ROI math, but they won't give it.

**You ask:** "How many agents on your team?"
**Prospect says:** "Oh, varies... we have a lot of part-timers..."

**Practice:** Get a usable number.

**Good response:**
```
"Ballpark is fine—are we talking closer to 10, 30, or 50+ agents
who are actively producing?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Gave ranges (easier to answer)
- [ ] Qualified "actively producing" (the number that matters)
- [ ] Didn't push for exact precision

---

### Scenario 9: The Skeptic
**Setup:** They don't believe AI can help.

**You ask:** "What's the biggest bottleneck for your agents?"
**Prospect says:** "Honestly, I don't think AI can help with real estate. It's too relationship-based."

**Practice:** Reframe without arguing.

**Good response:**
```
"You're right—AI won't replace the relationship part. That's the human stuff.
What it CAN do is handle the admin that eats into relationship time.
When your agents get a listing, how much time goes to the description,
the photos, the marketing—versus actually talking to the seller?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Agreed with their valid point
- [ ] Reframed AI's role
- [ ] Redirected to specific pain

---

### Scenario 10: The "We're Already Doing That"
**Setup:** They claim they've solved the problem.

**You ask:** "What have your agents tried with AI?"
**Prospect says:** "We're already using ChatGPT. Everyone has it."

**Practice:** Distinguish using vs. using well.

**Good response:**
```
"That's great you're ahead of most. Quick question—
when agents use ChatGPT, are they getting outputs they can use directly,
or are they still spending time fixing what it gives them?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Didn't argue they're "wrong"
- [ ] Asked about QUALITY of outputs
- [ ] Created opening for training value

---

## PART 3: OBJECTION SCENARIOS

### Scenario 11: "Too Expensive"
**Setup:** You've delivered the value prop. They push back on price.

**Prospect says:** "$5,000? That's way too expensive for a workshop."

**Practice:** EIR framework + ROI math.

**Good response:**
```
"I hear you—$5K is a real number. [EMPATHIZE]
Is it the total amount or the timing that's the concern? [ISOLATE]

[If total amount]:
Here's another way to look at it: [REFRAME]
For a team of 10 agents, if each saves 5 hours a week,
that's $130K in productivity annually.
The workshop is 4% of that. It pays for itself in month one.

Does that math work for your team?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Empathized first (didn't get defensive)
- [ ] Isolated the real concern
- [ ] Used specific math, not vague value claims

---

### Scenario 12: "Need to Think About It"
**Setup:** They're interested but won't commit.

**Prospect says:** "This sounds interesting, but I need to think about it."

**Practice:** Isolate the real concern.

**Good response:**
```
"Totally fair. What specifically would help you decide? [ISOLATE]
Is it the price, the timing, or something about how the workshop works?"

[Let them answer, then address that specific concern]
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Didn't push harder (makes them defensive)
- [ ] Asked clarifying question
- [ ] Identified the real blocker

---

### Scenario 13: "Send Me Information"
**Setup:** Classic brush-off.

**Prospect says:** "Can you just send me some information?"

**Practice:** Qualify before sending.

**Good response:**
```
"Happy to. Quick question first—
are you open to on-site training if the curriculum fits?
I don't want to waste your time with a PDF if this isn't something you'd consider."

[If yes]: "Great. What email should I use? And I'll follow up [specific day]."
[If no]: "Appreciate the honesty. Is there someone else at the brokerage who handles training?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Qualified before sending (is this a real opportunity?)
- [ ] Set a specific follow-up
- [ ] Didn't argue with the brush-off

---

### Scenario 14: "Bad Timing"
**Setup:** They say now isn't a good time.

**Prospect says:** "This isn't a good time. We're in the middle of our busy season."

**Practice:** Set a specific follow-up.

**Good response:**
```
"I hear you. When would be a better time to revisit this?
Q1? After the spring market?
I can set a reminder and follow up then—what works?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Didn't push against "bad timing"
- [ ] Offered specific timeframes
- [ ] Committed to a follow-up date

---

### Scenario 15: "My Agents Won't Use It"
**Setup:** Adoption concern.

**Prospect says:** "My agents are old-school. They're not going to use AI."

**Practice:** Reframe adoption.

**Good response:**
```
"I hear that a lot. Here's what's different—
they build the systems themselves during the workshop.
When you build something, you use it.
We've had agents in their 60s who'd never opened ChatGPT
leave confident and using AI daily.
If they can copy-paste, they can use this."
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Addressed the concern directly
- [ ] Offered proof (60-year-olds succeed)
- [ ] Reframed from "learning AI" to "building systems"

---

### Scenario 16: "We Already Had Training"
**Setup:** They've been burned before.

**Prospect says:** "We did AI training last year. Nobody uses it."

**Practice:** Differentiate without trashing competitors.

**Good response:**
```
"That happens a lot. What didn't translate to action?
Was it too theoretical? Not hands-on enough?

Most training doesn't stick because it's lecture, not practice.
Our agents build working systems live—
they use them Monday morning because they made them."
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Asked about their specific failure
- [ ] Positioned the difference (hands-on vs. lecture)
- [ ] Didn't trash the previous training directly

---

### Scenario 17: "Talk to My Office Manager"
**Setup:** They try to punt to someone else.

**Prospect says:** "You should really talk to my office manager about this."

**Practice:** Get the right contact OR stay with decision maker.

**Good response:**
```
"Happy to include them. Quick question—
when it comes to a $5K investment in training,
who would ultimately make that decision?
I want to make sure I'm talking to the right person."
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Didn't immediately accept the hand-off
- [ ] Qualified decision-making authority
- [ ] Kept the door open with current contact

---

### Scenario 18: "What Makes You Different?"
**Setup:** They want to understand your differentiator.

**Prospect says:** "There are a lot of AI training companies. What makes you different?"

**Practice:** Differentiate clearly.

**Good response:**
```
"Three things:

1. Hands-on, not lecture. Your agents build systems live—
   they leave with working tools, not notes.

2. Real estate specific. Every example is listings, follow-ups,
   marketing—not generic 'write me a poem' stuff.

3. One day, permanent results. The workshop is 6 hours.
   The 5-hour-a-week savings is forever.

What's most important to you—adoption, relevance, or ROI?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Gave 3 clear differentiators
- [ ] Ended with a question (keep discovery going)
- [ ] Didn't trash competitors

---

### Scenario 19: "I Need to Talk to My Partner"
**Setup:** They need another decision maker.

**Prospect says:** "This sounds good, but I need to talk to my partner first."

**Practice:** Get the partner on the call.

**Good response:**
```
"Totally understand. Would it make sense to loop [partner's name] in
so we can all discuss together?
I've got [Day 1] or [Day 2]—would either work for a quick call with both of you?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Respected the need for partner input
- [ ] Proposed a solution (joint call)
- [ ] Offered specific times

---

### Scenario 20: "The Market Is Slow"
**Setup:** They blame market conditions.

**Prospect says:** "The market is slow right now. We're not looking at any new expenses."

**Practice:** Reframe investment during slow periods.

**Good response:**
```
"I hear you—slow markets are tough.
Here's another way to look at it:
When the market picks up, the brokerages that trained during the slow time
will have agents who are 5 hours a week more productive than competitors.

Would it help to look at this as positioning for the recovery?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Acknowledged market reality
- [ ] Reframed slow period as opportunity
- [ ] Positioned training as competitive advantage

---

## PART 4: CLOSING SCENARIOS

### Scenario 21: The Direct Close
**Setup:** Strong buying signals. They're clearly interested.

**Prospect says:** "This sounds really good. How do we move forward?"

**Practice:** Close confidently.

**Good response:**
```
"Great. I've got [Day 1] or [Day 2] for a 15-minute call
to walk through the curriculum and answer any questions.
Which works better for you?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Didn't over-explain (they're ready)
- [ ] Offered two specific options
- [ ] Moved to logistics

---

### Scenario 22: The Alternative Close
**Setup:** They're interested but haven't committed.

**Prospect seems engaged but hasn't said yes.**

**Practice:** Prompt a decision with options.

**Good response:**
```
"Based on what you've shared, I think this could be a great fit.
I've got availability next Tuesday afternoon or Thursday morning—
which would work better for a quick follow-up call?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Assumed the next step (confidence)
- [ ] Gave two specific options (easier to choose than create)
- [ ] Kept it low-commitment (follow-up call, not contract)

---

### Scenario 23: The Hesitant Prospect
**Setup:** They're lukewarm but not saying no.

**Prospect says:** "I don't know... let me think about it..."

**Practice:** Lower the barrier.

**Good response:**
```
"Tell you what—can I send you the curriculum?
Take a look, and if it makes sense after you review it,
we'll find 15 minutes to discuss.
What email should I use?"
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Lowered commitment level
- [ ] Got their email (keeps door open)
- [ ] Planned next step

---

### Scenario 24: The Referral Ask
**Setup:** They said no. Get value anyway.

**Prospect says:** "This isn't for us. Good luck though."

**Practice:** Ask for referral.

**Good response:**
```
"Appreciate your time, [First Name].
Quick question before I let you go—
do you know any other brokerages in [City] who might benefit from this?
I'm offering $250 for any intro that books a call."
```

**Grade yourself:**
- [ ] Thanked them gracefully
- [ ] Made the referral ask
- [ ] Included incentive

---

### Scenario 25: The Calendar Lock
**Setup:** They said yes. Lock it down.

**Prospect says:** "Sure, let's do Thursday."

**Practice:** Confirm and send invite immediately.

**Good response:**
```
"Perfect. What time Thursday? Morning or afternoon?

[They say 2pm]

Got it. What email should I send the invite to?

[They give email]

Sending it now... [pause]... done. You should have it.
I'll attach the curriculum so you can review before we talk.
See you Thursday at 2, [First Name]."
```

- [ ] Got specific time
- [ ] Got email
- [ ] Sent invite WHILE ON THE CALL
- [ ] Confirmed receipt

---

**Setup:** Everything goes well. Practice the full flow.

**Run through all 6 stages:** CLARIFY → LABEL → OVERVIEW → VACATION → EXPLAIN → REINFORCE

**Partner plays:** Engaged prospect, 15 agents, pain around listing descriptions

**Target outcome:** Booked follow-up call

---

### Scenario 27: The Skeptic Call
**Setup:** They push back at every stage.

**Partner plays:** Skeptical, had bad training before, not sure AI works

**Target outcome:** Get permission to send curriculum

---

### Scenario 28: The Gatekeeper Run
**Setup:** Multiple barriers to decision maker.

**Partner plays:** Receptionist → Office Manager → Finally reaches broker

**Target outcome:** Conversation with broker

**Partner plays:** Very interested until you mention $5K, then hard pushback

**Target outcome:** Handle objection or downsell to $3K option
