# Call Script v2 (8-Stage Framework)

## Quick Frameworks (Memorize These)

### THE PACE FRAMEWORK (Your Call Structure)
```
P - Pattern Interrupt    → "I saw [Hook]..."
A - Ask Permission       → "Mind if I ask one question?"
C - Clarify Pain         → "What's your biggest bottleneck?"
E - Explain Value        → "Here's what we do..."
→ Then CLOSE: "[Day 1] or [Day 2]?"
```

### THE HOOK-BRIDGE-CLOSE (Opening Formula)
```
HOOK:   "[Read AI Opening Hook from sheet]"
BRIDGE: "I help brokerages get agents using AI that saves time."
CLOSE:  "Mind if I ask one question?"
```

### THE $500 MATH (Say This Exactly)
```
"If AI saves each agent 5 hours a week,
that's $500 a month per agent.
For a team of 10, that's $60K a year.
The workshop pays for itself month one."
```

### THE EIR OBJECTION FORMULA
```
E - Empathize  → "I hear you..."
I - Isolate    → "Is it the [X] or [Y]?"
R - Reframe    → "Here's another way to look at it..."
```

## Overview

This script is designed for both experienced and newer reps:
- **Bold text** = say exactly as written
- *Italic text* = adapt to context
- [Brackets] = fill in from lead sheet

---

## Stage 1: Pattern Interrupt Opening (15 seconds)

### If They Received Email
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration—
I sent you an email about [reference AI Subject Line].
Got a quick moment?"
```

### If Cold Call (No Email)
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name].
[Read AI Opening Hook exactly as written].
Quick question for you."
```

### If Gatekeeper
```
"Hi, this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.
I'm trying to reach [First Name]—is [he/she] available?"
```

If asked what it's about:
```
"I'm following up on an email about AI training for their agents.
It's a quick call—is [he/she] available?"
```

---

## Stage 2: Permission & Framing (15 seconds)

Once you have the decision maker:

```
"I help brokerages like [Casual Company] get their agents using AI
in ways that actually save time—not just another tech demo.
Mind if I ask one question?"
```

*Wait for permission. If they say "sure" or "okay", proceed.*

If they say "I only have a minute":
```
"Perfect—I'll be quick. One question..."
```

---

## Stage 3: Discovery Questions (60-90 seconds)

Pick 2-3 based on conversation flow:

### Pain Identification
```
"What's your biggest bottleneck right now—
marketing, operations, or agent productivity?"
```

### Current State
```
"How are your agents handling listing descriptions
and follow-up emails today?"
```

### AI Experience
```
"Have you or your team tried any AI tools yet?
What happened?"
```

### Training History
```
"When you think about training, what's worked vs. what's flopped?"
```

### Team Size (for ROI math)
```
"How many agents do you have on your team?"
```

**Listen carefully. Take notes. Their answers shape your pitch.**

---

## Stage 4: Qualify the Pain (30 seconds)

Repeat back what you heard:

```
"So if I'm hearing you right, [summarize their pain].
If we could solve that in one day, would that be worth exploring?"
```

Examples:
- *"So your agents are spending hours on listing descriptions..."*
- *"So the training you've tried hasn't stuck..."*
- *"So you're worried about AI but curious about what's possible..."*

*Wait for confirmation before pitching.*

---

## Stage 5: Value Proposition (60 seconds)

### Core Pitch
```
"Here's what we do: One-day workshop, on-site at your office.
Your agents walk out with:

1. A working AI system they use Monday morning
2. Prompts for listings, emails, social—ready to go
3. Fraud detection training—critical right now

The math: If AI saves each agent 5 hours a week,
that's $500 a month per agent in recovered productivity.
For a team of [their number] agents, you're looking at
[calculate: agents × $500 × 12] a year.
The workshop is $5,000—pays for itself in the first month."
```

### Quick Math Reference
| Agents | Monthly Value | Annual Value |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| 5 | $2,500 | $30,000 |
| 10 | $5,000 | $60,000 |
| 20 | $10,000 | $120,000 |
| 50 | $25,000 | $300,000 |

### Adapt Based on Discovery

If they mentioned **productivity**:
```
"Your top agents will get even more productive.
Your average agents start performing like your top agents."
```

If they mentioned **training that didn't stick**:
```
"This isn't a webinar they forget. They build systems live.
They leave with prompts they use Monday morning."
```

If they mentioned **AI skepticism**:
```
"We've trained agents who'd never opened ChatGPT.
They leave confident. If they don't use it, I want to know why."
```

---

## Stage 6: Vendor Value-Add (30 seconds)

```
"By the way—you know how lenders and title companies
are always looking for face time with your agents?
We can bring them in as sponsors.
They cover part of the cost, your agents get trained, everyone wins."
```

*Only use if they seem price-sensitive or need extra push.*

---

## Stage 7: Close (30 seconds)

### Primary Close (Calendar)
```
"I've got availability [specific dates].
Would [Day 1] or [Day 2] work better
for a 15-minute call to walk through the curriculum?"
```

### Alternative Close (If Hesitant)
```
"Tell you what—can I send you the curriculum?
Take a look, and if it makes sense,
we can find 15 minutes to discuss?"
```

### Trial Close (Test the Water)
```
"Does this sound like something that could help your team?"
```

---

## Stage 8: Post-Call Actions

### If BOOKED
1. Confirm email address
2. Send calendar invite immediately
3. Attach curriculum PDF
4. Update sheet: Status = "Booked", add booking notes
5. Set reminder for pre-call prep

### If "NOT NOW" / FOLLOW-UP
1. Ask: *"When would be a better time to reconnect?"*
2. Set specific follow-up date
3. Update sheet: Status = "Contacted", add Follow Up Date
4. Trigger downsell email sequence (3-hour workshop)

### If "NOT INTERESTED"
1. Ask: *"Mind if I ask—is it the timing or the concept?"*
2. Note reason in Call Notes
3. Ask: *"Do you know any other brokerages in [City] who might benefit?"*
4. Update sheet: Status = "Not Interested"
5. Trigger referral email

### If "BAD DATA" (wrong person, wrong number, out of business)
1. Update sheet: Status = "Bad Data"
2. Note what's wrong
3. Flag for research team
4. Move to next lead

## Objection Quick Reference

When you hit an objection, don't panic. Use these pocket responses:

| Objection | Quick Response |
|-----------|----------------|
| "Too busy" | "That's exactly why this matters—5-10 hours/week back." |
| "Too expensive" | "It's $500/agent. One extra deal = 2:1 ROI." |
| "Already using AI" | "Using vs. using well are different. We teach systems." |
| "Need to think about it" | "What specifically would help you decide?" |
| "Send info" | "Happy to. Are you open to on-site training if it fits?" |

*For deeper responses, see `objections/` folder.*

## Script Variations

### For Associations (vs. Brokerages)
```
"Your members are asking about AI—we've heard it from
every association we've talked to. This gives you a
high-value event that drives attendance AND can be
partially sponsor-funded."
```

### For Larger Brokerages (50+ agents)
```
"At your scale, even a 10% productivity improvement
across [X] agents is massive. We can do multiple sessions
or train-the-trainer if that works better."
```

### For Skeptical Prospects
```
"I get the skepticism—everyone's pitching AI right now.
Here's what's different: We've built this specifically
for real estate. Fraud detection. Fair Housing guardrails.
Prompts for YOUR workflows."
```

## Tone Guidelines

### Do
- Sound like a human, not a robot
- Match their energy (if they're casual, be casual)
- Use their name naturally
- Pause after questions (let them think)

### Don't
- Rush through the script
- Sound desperate for the booking
- Argue with objections (redirect instead)
- Oversell or overpromise

### Your Mindset
You're not selling—you're **helping them discover** if this is a fit.
If it's not, thank them and move on. Not every lead is a customer.
