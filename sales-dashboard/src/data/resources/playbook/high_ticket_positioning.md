# High-Ticket Positioning (Becker Method)

How to position a $5,000 workshop as the obvious choice—not an expensive risk.

---

## The Core Mindset Shift

### Old Frame: Seller
```
"I'm trying to get them to buy"
"$5K is expensive, I need to justify it"
"Every lead is a potential customer"
"I hope they say yes"
"I'm interrupting their day"
```

### New Frame: Consultant
```
"I'm here to see if they qualify"
"The price is fair for the value—no apology needed"
"Not every lead is a fit—and that's fine"
"I'm helping them make the right decision either way"
"I'm offering value, not asking for a favor"
```

### Why This Matters
When you operate from the Seller frame, you:
- Sound needy (tonality suffers)
- Over-explain (talking yourself out of the sale)
- Discount before being asked
- Chase people who aren't good fits

When you operate from the Consultant frame, you:
- Sound confident (tonality improves)
- Ask questions (discovery drives decisions)
- Hold price because you believe in value
- Disqualify bad fits early

## The Three Becker Principles

### 1. You Solve Expensive Problems

**The Reframe:**
You're not selling a workshop. You're solving a $130,000/year productivity problem.

**How to Position It:**
```
"For a team of 10 agents losing 5 hours a week to admin,
that's $130,000 in productivity every year.

The workshop is $5,000—that's 4% of the problem you're solving.
It pays for itself in month one."
```

**The Psychology:**
When the problem is expensive, the solution can be too. Never apologize for price when the ROI is clear.

### 2. Fear of Missing Out > Fear of Spending

**The Timeline Urgency:**
```
"AI is moving fast.
Six months from now, this is table stakes.
The brokerages training their agents NOW will have a head start.
The ones waiting will be playing catch-up."
```

**How to Use It:**
- Mention timeline naturally in Vacation stage
- Reference competitors who are adopting
- Frame delay as a competitive risk

**The Psychology:**
People are more motivated to avoid loss than to gain reward. Frame inaction as the risky choice.

### 3. Position as Selection, Not Persuasion

**The Language Shift:**

| Seller Language | Consultant Language |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| "Would you like to..." | "Based on what you've shared, you'd be a good fit." |
| "We'd love to work with you" | "I think we can help—the question is timing." |
| "Let me convince you" | "Let me see if this makes sense for you." |
| "Please consider..." | "This is what we do. Does it fit?" |

**The Psychology:**
When you position yourself as selecting clients, the prospect's frame shifts from "Should I buy?" to "Will they accept me?"

## The Qualification Questions

Before pitching, ask these. If they fail, disqualify.

### Question 1: Team Size
```
"How many agents do you have on your team?"
```

**Disqualify if:** Solo agent or < 5 agents (no leverage, hard to justify $5K)

**Transition out:**
```
"Got it. Honestly, this is designed for larger teams—
the ROI really kicks in at 10+ agents.
Can I ask—do you know any larger brokerages in the area
who might benefit?"
```

### Question 2: Decision Authority
```
"When it comes to a $5K investment in training,
who would need to weigh in on that decision?"
```

**Disqualify if:** They're not the decision maker AND can't get you to the decision maker

**Transition out:**
```
"Makes sense. Would it be helpful if I spoke with [decision maker] directly?
I can make sure they have the right info."
```

### Question 3: Budget Reality
```
"Just so I don't waste your time—
this workshop is $5,000.
Is that something you'd consider if the curriculum fits?"
```

**Disqualify if:** Clear "no budget" with no path forward

**Transition out:**
```
"Understood. We also have a 3-hour option at $3,000 if that's more realistic.
Or I can follow up next quarter when budgets reset.
What makes more sense?"
```

### Question 4: Timing
```
"If this made sense, what would the timeline look like?
Q1? Q2?"
```

**Disqualify if:** "We're not thinking about training for at least a year" (unless you want to nurture)

## Price Presentation (Never Apologize)

### The Wrong Way (Apologetic)
```
"So... the workshop is $5,000.
I know that might seem like a lot, but..."
```

**What's wrong:** Immediately signals uncertainty. Plants doubt.

### The Right Way (Matter of Fact)
```
"The workshop is $5,000.
For a team of 10 agents, that's $500 per agent.
One extra deal per agent more than covers it."
```

**What's right:** States price as fact. Immediately connects to value.

### The Power Move (Consultant Frame)
```
"The workshop is $5,000.
Based on what you've told me—10 agents losing 5 hours a week—
that's a 26:1 ROI in year one.
Does that math work for you?"
```

**What's powerful:** Puts THEM in the position of evaluating the math, not you defending the price.

## Handling the "$5K Is Too Much" Objection

### Level 1: The Math Reframe
```
"I hear you. Let me run through the math:

5 hours/week × $50/hour × 10 agents × 52 weeks = $130,000 in recovered productivity.

The workshop is $5,000—that's 4% of that.
It pays for itself in month one.

Does that change the equation?"
```

### Level 2: The Per-Agent Breakdown
```
"Another way to look at it:
$5,000 ÷ 10 agents = $500 per agent.

One extra deal per agent pays for it twice over.
Is one extra deal per agent realistic?"
```

### Level 3: The Cost of Waiting
```
"I understand. What's the cost of NOT doing this?

Your agents are losing 5+ hours a week.
In 6 months, that's 130 hours per agent going to admin.
Meanwhile, competitors are training their teams.

What's that worth?"
```

### Level 4: The Downsell (Last Resort)
```
"We also have a 3-hour Implementation Workshop at $3,000.
It covers the core skills without the deep dive.

Would that be a better fit for your budget?"
```

## The High-Ticket Close

### Standard Close (Assumptive + Alternative)
```
"Based on what you've shared, I think this is a great fit.
I've got [Day 1] or [Day 2] for a follow-up call to go deeper.
Which works better?"
```

### Premium Close (Selection Frame)
```
"Based on what you've told me, you'd be a good candidate for this.
The question is whether the timing works on your end.

What does your calendar look like next week?"
```

### The "I'm Booked" Close
```
"I have two spots left this quarter.
If the curriculum makes sense after our next call,
I can hold one for you.

What day works to walk through it?"
```

## Confidence Anchors

Say these OUT LOUD before calls to prime the right frame:

1. **"I have something valuable. I'm here to see if they qualify."**

2. **"The price is fair. The ROI is clear. No apology needed."**

3. **"Not everyone is a fit. That's fine. I'm looking for the right fit."**

4. **"I'm not convincing. I'm consulting."**

5. **"If they're not ready, someone else is. Just dial."**

## Red Flags (Disqualify Fast)

| Red Flag | What to Say |
|----------|-------------|
| Solo agent, no team | "This is designed for teams. Best of luck." |
| "I have no budget" (definitive) | "Understood. Can I ask—is there anyone else in the area who might benefit?" |
| Wants free advice, not training | "Happy to share more on a paid engagement. Here's the curriculum." |
| Argumentative, disrespectful | "Appreciate your time. Sounds like this isn't a fit. Have a good day." |
| Decision maker unavailable indefinitely | "I'll follow up when [decision maker] is available. When's a good time to check back?" |

---

## The Becker Script Elements

### Opening (Selection Positioning)
```
"I work with brokerages that want their agents to stop drowning in admin
and start closing more deals."
```

**Why it works:** Positions as selective ("brokerages that want")—not desperate for anyone.

### Discovery (Qualification Focus)
```
"Quick question before I go further—
when it comes to training investments like this,
who else would need to weigh in?"
```

**Why it works:** Qualifies decision-making authority early. Saves time.

### Vacation (Competitive Urgency)
```
"The brokerages training their agents NOW will have a head start.
The ones waiting will be playing catch-up."
```

**Why it works:** Frames inaction as risky. Creates urgency without discounting.

### Close (Consultant Frame)
```
"Based on what you've shared, I think you'd be a good fit for this.
The question is whether the timing works."
```

**Why it works:** YOU are selecting THEM. Flips the power dynamic.

## Daily High-Ticket Affirmations

Read before every call block:

1. I solve a $130,000 problem. My solution is $5,000. The math works.

2. I don't need this sale. I want to find the right clients.

3. Price objections mean they don't understand value yet. That's my job to fix.

4. I'm a consultant. I diagnose problems and prescribe solutions.

5. Not everyone qualifies. That's by design.

6. Confidence isn't arrogance. It's certainty in the value I provide.

7. If this call doesn't work, the next one will. Just dial.

---

## The High-Ticket Hierarchy

```
VALUE > PRICE > RELATIONSHIP

1. Establish VALUE first (ROI, outcomes, transformation)
2. PRICE becomes reasonable in context of value
3. RELATIONSHIP seals the deal (trust, rapport, credibility)

Most reps go: Relationship → Price → (hope for) Value
Winners go: Value → Price → Relationship
```

## Quick Reference: Becker vs. Hormozi

| Element | Hormozi (CLOSER) | Becker (High-Ticket) |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| Frame | Discovery-first | Selection-first |
| Objections | Pre-frame concerns | Qualify out bad fits |
| Price | ROI math | "Expensive problem" positioning |
| Close | "Does that sound worth exploring?" | "I think you'd be a good fit" |
| Mindset | Helping them discover | Evaluating if they qualify |

**Best practice:** Use both. CLOSER for call structure. Becker for mindset and positioning.
