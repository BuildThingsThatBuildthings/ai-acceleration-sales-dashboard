# Tonality & Conviction Training

The words are 10%. How you say them is 90%.

This guide teaches the invisible skill that separates average reps from closers.

## The Hormozi Rule

> "10% is the words, 90% is how you say the words. You must either trick or train yourself how to use tonality. The trick: Conviction will correct your tone. You need to truly believe the product is AMAZING—otherwise you can't convince the prospect."

### What This Means
- Perfect script + bad tonality = no sale
- Imperfect script + strong conviction = closed deal
- Belief is not optional—it's required

### The Conviction Test
Ask yourself: "Would I recommend this to my mom if she owned a brokerage?"
- If yes: You're ready to sell
- If no: Don't get on the phone until you believe

## The 5 Tonality States

### 1. Curious (Discovery)
**When to use:** CLARIFY and OVERVIEW stages
**Sounds like:** Genuine interest, slightly upward inflection on questions
**Energy level:** Medium, engaged

**Example:**
- BAD: "What's your biggest bottleneck?" (flat, checking a box)
- GOOD: "What's your biggest bottleneck?" (genuine curiosity, you actually want to know)

**Practice phrase:** "That's interesting—tell me more about that."

---

### 2. Certain (Labeling)
**When to use:** LABEL stage when quantifying their problem
**Sounds like:** Matter-of-fact, lower pitch, definitive
**Energy level:** Medium-high, grounded

**Example:**
- BAD: "So that's like... maybe... $130K in lost productivity?" (uncertain)
- GOOD: "That's $130,000 in productivity going to admin instead of deals." (statement, not question)

**Practice phrase:** "That's the bottleneck, right?"

---

### 3. Empathetic (Objections)
**When to use:** First response to any objection
**Sounds like:** Warm, understanding, slower pace
**Energy level:** Lower, softer

**Example:**
- BAD: "Well, actually..." (defensive)
- GOOD: "I hear you. That makes total sense." (pause, let it land)

**Practice phrase:** "I completely understand why you'd feel that way."

---

### 4. Excited (Vacation Selling)
**When to use:** SELL VACATION stage
**Sounds like:** Energy increase, painting a picture, forward leaning
**Energy level:** Higher, aspirational

**Example:**
- BAD: "So yeah, they'll save some time on listings and stuff." (bored)
- GOOD: "Imagine it's Monday morning—your agents type 3 sentences and get back a listing description that used to take 45 minutes. Done. Move on." (energy, vision)

**Practice phrase:** "The workshop is one day. The results are permanent."

---

### 5. Calm Confidence (Closing)
**When to use:** REINFORCE stage, asking for commitment
**Sounds like:** Lower pitch, slower pace, no desperation
**Energy level:** Medium-low, grounded, unfazed

**Example:**
- BAD: "So, uh, would you maybe want to set up a call or something?" (needy)
- GOOD: "I've got Tuesday or Thursday. Which works better?" (assumes the yes)

**Practice phrase:** "Does that sound worth 15 minutes to explore?"

## The Voice Mechanics

### Pitch
| State | Pitch |
|-------|-------|
| Curious | Slightly higher at end of questions |
| Certain | Lower, definitive |
| Empathetic | Mid-range, warm |
| Excited | Varies, more range |
| Confident | Lower, steady |

**Red flag:** If your pitch goes UP at the end of statements (not questions), you sound uncertain.

### Pace
| State | Pace |
|-------|------|
| Curious | Normal |
| Certain | Slightly slower |
| Empathetic | Slower |
| Excited | Faster, but clear |
| Confident | Slower, with pauses |

**Red flag:** Rushing = nervousness. Slow down, especially on closes.

### Volume
| State | Volume |
|-------|--------|
| Curious | Normal |
| Certain | Slightly louder |
| Empathetic | Slightly softer |
| Excited | Louder |
| Confident | Normal to slightly softer (draws them in) |

**Red flag:** Loud throughout = pushy. Soft throughout = weak.

### Pauses
Strategic silence is a weapon.

**When to pause:**
- After asking a discovery question
- After stating a problem (let it sink in)
- After presenting price or ROI
- After asking for the close

**How long:** 2-3 seconds feels like an eternity on the phone. That's perfect.

## The Conviction Builders

### Daily Affirmations (Read Before Call Block)
Say these OUT LOUD. Tone matters even when talking to yourself.

1. "I have something valuable. I'm here to see if they qualify."
2. "The math is simple. It either makes sense or it doesn't."
3. "Every 'no' gets me closer to 'yes.'"
4. "I'm helping, not selling."
5. "Conviction corrects tonality."
6. "The workshop is one day. The results are permanent."
7. "I've done this before. I'll do it again. Just dial."

### The Belief Stack
When you doubt yourself, remember:

**What AI Actually Does for Agents:**
- 45-minute listing descriptions → 5 minutes
- Forgotten follow-ups → Never miss again
- 60-hour weeks → 50-hour weeks
- Stress and burnout → Confidence and systems

**What the ROI Actually Is:**
- 5 hours/week × $50/hour × 10 agents × 52 weeks = $130,000
- Workshop cost: $5,000
- ROI: 26:1
- Payback: Month 1

**What Happens If They Don't Train:**
- Competitors adopt AI first
- Agents burn out and leave
- 6 months from now, this is table stakes
- They're not saving money—they're losing time

### The "Would I?" Test
Before every call, ask:
- Would I buy this for my team? (If yes, proceed)
- Would I recommend this to a friend? (If yes, proceed)
- Am I proud of this product? (If yes, proceed)

If ANY answer is no, don't call. Fix your belief first.

## Tonality Drills

### Drill 1: The Pitch Drop
**Purpose:** Sound certain, not uncertain

**Exercise:**
1. Say: "The workshop costs five thousand dollars." (normal)
2. Say: "The workshop costs five thousand dollars." (pitch up at end = uncertain)
3. Say: "The workshop costs five thousand dollars." (pitch down at end = certain)

Record all three. Listen. Feel the difference.

**Practice until:** Version 3 is your default.

---

### Drill 2: The Pause Power
**Purpose:** Use silence as a tool

**Exercise:**
1. Ask: "What's your biggest bottleneck right now?"
2. COUNT TO 5 in your head before saying anything else
3. Even if they start answering, don't interrupt

**Practice until:** 3-5 second pauses feel natural.

---

### Drill 3: The Energy Modulation
**Purpose:** Match tonality to call stage

**Exercise:**
Read this script out loud, changing energy:

```
[CURIOUS - medium energy, interested]
"What's eating up your agents' time right now?"

[CERTAIN - lower pitch, definitive]
"That's $130,000 in lost productivity per year."

[EMPATHETIC - warm, slower]
"I hear you. That makes total sense."

[EXCITED - higher energy, vision]
"Imagine your agents typing 3 sentences and getting a full listing description in 5 minutes. Every time."

[CONFIDENT - lower pitch, calm]
"I've got Tuesday or Thursday. Which works better?"
```

Record yourself. Listen for the energy shifts.

---

### Drill 4: The Mirror Test
**Purpose:** See what prospects "hear"

**Exercise:**
1. Stand in front of a mirror
2. Deliver your opening
3. Watch your face and body language
4. Ask: "Would I trust this person?"

**What to look for:**
- Genuine smile (not forced)
- Open body language (not closed/defensive)
- Eye contact (even with yourself)
- Relaxed shoulders (not tense)

---

### Drill 5: The Recording Review
**Purpose:** Objective self-assessment

**Exercise:**
1. Record your next 5 calls (with permission if required)
2. Listen back with this checklist:

| Element | Yes | No |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Voice pitch appropriate to stage? | | |
| Pauses after questions? | | |
| Slower pace on empathy/close? | | |
| No filler words (um, like, you know)? | | |
| Sounds like conversation, not script? | | |
| Would I trust this person? | | |

## Common Tonality Mistakes

### Mistake 1: The Upspeak Curse
**What it is:** Ending statements with rising pitch (sounds like a question)
**Example:** "The workshop is $5,000?" (sounds uncertain)
**Fix:** Drop pitch at end: "The workshop is $5,000." (period energy)

### Mistake 2: The Nervous Rush
**What it is:** Speaking too fast, especially when nervous
**Example:** "So-basically-we-do-this-AI-training-and-it-saves-time-and..."
**Fix:** Breathe. Pause between sentences. Slow is confident.

### Mistake 3: The Monotone Trap
**What it is:** Same energy throughout (usually medium-low)
**Example:** Same pitch, pace, volume for 4 minutes straight
**Fix:** Practice energy modulation. Discovery = curious. Vacation = excited. Close = calm.

### Mistake 4: The Apology Tone
**What it is:** Sounding sorry for calling or mentioning price
**Example:** "I know $5,000 is a lot, but..." (apologetic)
**Fix:** "The workshop is $5,000. For 10 agents, that's $500 each." (matter of fact)

### Mistake 5: The Over-Enthusiasm
**What it is:** Too much energy, sounds salesy
**Example:** "This is AMAZING and your agents will LOVE it!"
**Fix:** Dial back 20%. Confident excitement, not desperate excitement.

## The Hormozi Conviction Statements

Use these when you feel yourself slipping into uncertain tonality:

| Statement | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|
| "I know this works because I've seen it work." | After skepticism |
| "The math is simple. It either makes sense or it doesn't." | After price objection |
| "I'm not here to convince you. I'm here to see if it fits." | When they're hesitant |
| "If this doesn't help your agents, I want to know why." | When you need to ground yourself |
| "The workshop is one day. The results are permanent." | In vacation selling |

## The Becker Mindset Layer

### Frame: You're the Prize

**Old frame (Seller):**
- "I hope they say yes"
- "I need this sale"
- "Please give me 2 minutes"

**New frame (Consultant):**
- "I'm here to see if they qualify"
- "Not everyone is a fit, and that's fine"
- "I have something valuable—do they want it?"

### How This Changes Tonality
- Less needy = lower pitch, slower pace
- More certain = definitive statements, no apologizing
- Detached from outcome = relaxed, conversational

### The Consultant Test
After every call, ask: "Did I sound like I needed the sale, or like I was evaluating them?"

---

## Pre-Call Ritual (The Conviction Warmup)

**5 minutes before call block:**

1. **Body:** Stand up. Shoulders back. Deep breath.
2. **Belief:** Say out loud: "I have something valuable."
3. **Review:** Read one belief stack item (ROI, what AI does, etc.)
4. **Practice:** Deliver your opening out loud once
5. **Commit:** "I'm ready. Just dial."

---

## Tonality Recovery (When You're Off)

### Signs You've Lost It
- Voice pitch creeping up
- Speaking faster than normal
- Filling silence with "ums" and "likes"
- Feeling defensive
- Wanting the call to end

### The Reset
1. **Pause.** Take a breath. Don't fill the silence.
2. **Ground.** Say to yourself: "I'm helping, not selling."
3. **Slow.** Next sentence at half speed.
4. **Lower.** Drop your pitch slightly.
5. **Question.** Ask them something (puts focus back on them)

### The Emergency Phrase
If you're really off, say:
"Let me pause for a second. I want to make sure I'm actually understanding your situation."

This buys you time to reset AND makes you sound thoughtful.

## Weekly Tonality Check

Every Friday, review these questions:

1. Did I record any calls this week?
2. What tonality mistake did I catch?
3. What's one thing I'll practice next week?
4. On a scale of 1-10, how strong is my conviction right now?
5. If conviction is <8, what do I need to re-believe?

---

## The Final Word

> "The difference between a $50K/year rep and a $150K/year rep isn't the script. It's the conviction behind the script. You can't fake belief. Either you have it, or you don't. If you don't, go back to the product until you do."

Conviction is a skill. Train it like any other.
