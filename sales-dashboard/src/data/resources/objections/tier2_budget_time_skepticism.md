# Tier 2: Heavy-Hitter Objections (Your Main Barriers)

These are the objections that kill deals. Master the layered responses.

---

## Budget: "$5,000 is too much"

This is your #1 barrier. Have three layers ready.

### Layer 1: The Per-Agent Math (First Response)
```
"I hear you—$5K is real money.
Let me ask: how many agents on your team?"

[They say 10]

"Okay, so that's $500 per agent for a full day of training.
Compare that to any certification course—this is hands-on,
practical, and they use it Monday morning.

What would make this feel like a no-brainer?"
```

### Layer 2: The Vendor Sponsor Angle (If They Push Back)
```
"What if we could offset the cost?

Lenders, title companies, inspectors—they're always
looking for face time with your agents. We can bring
them in as sponsors. They cover $1-2K, your agents
get trained.

Would that change the math?"
```

### Layer 3: The Downsell (Final Attempt)
```
"Tell you what—we also do a 3-hour version for $3,000.
Half the time, focused on the highest-impact skills.

Would that work better for your team's schedule and budget?"
```

### Additional Angles

**The One-Deal ROI:**
```
"One extra deal this year from recovered time = $10K+ commission.
The workshop is $5K. That's 2:1 ROI on just one deal.
And we're talking 5-10 hours saved per week, every week."
```

**The Cost of Doing Nothing:**
```
"What's it costing you NOT to have your agents trained on AI?
While you wait, competitors are pulling ahead.
In 6 months, this will feel like table stakes."
```

**The Payment Flexibility:**
```
"Would it help to split this across two payments?
Or tie it to a specific quarter's budget?"
```

---

## Time/Scheduling: "Can't get agents together for a full day"

This is the logistical objection. Have solutions ready.

### Layer 1: Schedule Far Out (First Response)
```
"Totally get it—agents are independent. Here's what works:

We schedule 4-6 weeks out. You pick a slow day—
not open house Saturday. Maybe a Tuesday or Wednesday.

And we make it mandatory CE credit-eligible where possible.

What day of the week usually has the lightest schedule?"
```

### Layer 2: Split Sessions (If They Push Back)
```
"What if we did two half-days?

Morning session one week, afternoon the next.
Same content, split for busy schedules.
Easier to get attendance for 3 hours vs. 6."
```

### Layer 3: The 3-Hour Option (Final Alternative)
```
"We also have a 3-hour option—tight, tactical, lunchtime format.

Agents in at 11, out by 2. Same core skills.
That easier to coordinate?"
```

### Additional Angles

**The Mandatory Meeting Frame:**
```
"You have office meetings, right? This replaces one of those.
Same time commitment, 100x the value.
Make it mandatory and call it 'professional development.'"
```

**The Recording Option:**
```
"For agents who absolutely can't make it, we can provide
key materials for catch-up. But honestly? The live workshop
is where the magic happens. Hands-on beats recordings."
```

**The Accountability Frame:**
```
"If you're struggling to get agents to commit to one day,
that's actually a sign they NEED this.
Agents who won't invest in themselves are the ones
struggling most with productivity."
```

---

## Skepticism: "AI won't actually help my agents"

This is fear masquerading as logic. Address the underlying concern.

### Layer 1: Understand Their Experience (First Response)
```
"What makes you say that?
Have your agents tried AI tools before?"
```

*Listen carefully. Their answer reveals the real concern.*

**If they tried and failed:**
```
"That's exactly why we exist.

Most agents try ChatGPT once, get generic garbage, and give up.
We teach the context—the voice cards, the prompts, the iteration.
That's where the magic happens.

What went wrong when they tried it?"
```

**If they haven't tried:**
```
"Fair skepticism. Here's our promise:

Agents leave with working systems they use Monday morning.
Not theory—actual prompts for listings, emails, social posts.
If they don't use it, I want to know why."
```

### Layer 2: Offer Proof (If Still Skeptical)
```
"Tell you what—what if I sent you three prompts
your agents can try TODAY, before you commit to anything?

If they work, we talk.
If they don't, no hard feelings. Fair?"
```

*Then send them:*
- Prompting Framework Card
- 3 real estate-specific prompts (listing description, follow-up email, social post)

### Layer 3: Address the Real Fear (Social Proof Angle)
```
"I get it—everyone's pitching AI right now.
Here's what's different:

We've built this specifically for real estate.
Fraud detection training. Fair Housing guardrails.
Prompts for YOUR workflows.

Would it help to see the curriculum before deciding?"
```

### Additional Angles

**The "Agents Aren't Tech-Savvy" Response:**
```
"Neither are most. That's why we start with mental models,
not technical jargon. We've trained agents who'd never
opened ChatGPT—they leave confident and using it."
```

**The "AI Will Replace Agents" Response:**
```
"AI doesn't replace agents—it replaces tasks.
The listing description, not the relationship.
The follow-up email, not the negotiation.
Your agents become more valuable, not less."
```

**The "It's Just a Fad" Response:**
```
"That's what people said about email. About smartphones.
92% of real estate teams are piloting AI right now.
The question isn't if—it's when.
Better to be ahead than behind."
```

## Handling Layered Pushback

Sometimes they'll object multiple times. Stack your responses:

### Example: Budget + Skepticism
```
Prospect: "It's too expensive AND I'm not sure it'll work."

You: "Fair. Let's address both.

On price—it's $500 per agent for a full day.
If each agent saves 5 hours a week, that's a 12:1 ROI.
Pays for itself month one.

On whether it works—what if I sent you three prompts
your agents can try today? If they work, we talk.
If not, you haven't lost anything.

Sound reasonable?"
```

### Example: Time + Budget
```
Prospect: "We can't get everyone together AND it's expensive."

You: "Got it. Here's a thought:

We have a 3-hour option for $3,000.
Lunchtime format—agents in at 11, out by 2.
Easier to schedule, lower investment.

Would that make it easier to move forward?"
```

## Quick Reference: Budget/Time/Skepticism

| Objection | Layer 1 | Layer 2 | Layer 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Budget** | Per-agent math ($500/head) | Vendor sponsors | 3-hour downsell ($3K) |
| **Time** | Schedule 4-6 weeks out | Split into 2 half-days | 3-hour lunchtime option |
| **Skepticism** | Understand their experience | Send proof prompts | Curriculum review |

## Practice Scenarios

Before calls, practice these situations:

**Scenario 1:**
"We can't afford $5,000 right now."
→ Walk through all three budget layers

**Scenario 2:**
"My agents are too busy for a full day."
→ Walk through all three time layers

**Scenario 3:**
"I tried ChatGPT and it was useless."
→ Walk through all three skepticism layers

**Scenario 4:**
"It's too expensive AND my agents won't use it."
→ Combine budget + skepticism responses

You should be able to handle any combination without hesitation.
