# Lead Scoring System

## Purpose

Not all leads are equal. This system helps you:
1. Prioritize who to call first
2. Adjust your approach based on lead quality
3. Focus energy where it matters most

## Using Scores in Conversation

### For HOT Leads
```
Mindset: They're interested. Don't oversell.
Opening: "Thanks for getting back to me..."
Goal: Book the call quickly
Approach: Less discovery, more scheduling
```

### For WARM Leads
```
Mindset: They're curious but not committed.
Opening: "I noticed you [engagement action]..."
Goal: Qualify and move to booking
Approach: Medium discovery, address concerns
```

### For COLD Leads
```
Mindset: They don't know you. Build rapport.
Opening: Standard pattern interrupt
Goal: Qualify whether they're worth pursuing
Approach: More discovery, qualify fit
```

## Maintaining Score Accuracy

### Weekly Score Review

Every Friday:
1. Review all "HOT" leads - are they still hot?
2. Check "WARM" leads - any gone cold?
3. Identify new email engagement - upgrade scores
4. Clean out stale leads - downgrade or remove

### Common Scoring Mistakes

**Don't:**
- Score everyone as HOT (dilutes meaning)
- Ignore email engagement data
- Forget to downgrade non-responsive leads
- Let old scores sit stale

**Do:**
- Re-score after every interaction
- Use email data to inform scores
- Regularly clean up your list
- Trust the system - call HOT leads first
