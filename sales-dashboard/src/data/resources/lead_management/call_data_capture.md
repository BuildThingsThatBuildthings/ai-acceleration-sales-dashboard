## Data Quality Flags

### Flag immediately when you discover:

**Bad Contact Info**
```
[ ] Wrong phone number → Note what happened
[ ] Wrong email → Note if they gave correct one
[ ] Wrong person → Note who the RIGHT contact is
[ ] Out of business → Confirm with quick search
[ ] Duplicate → Reference which row is duplicate
```

**Better Contact Info**
```
"Talked to [Gatekeeper]. Real decision maker is [Name].
Direct line: [Number]. Best time to call: [Time]."
```

**Company Updates**
```
"Company was acquired by [New Company]"
"[Person] no longer there, now at [New Company]"
"Changed name to [New Name]"
```

---

## Capturing Objections

When you hear an objection, write it DOWN.

### Good Objection Notes
```
Objection: "We already use ChatGPT"
Context: Managing broker, 15 agents, Louisville
Their words: "My agents tried it but it was generic garbage"
My response: Used "using vs. using well" reframe
Result: Agreed to look at curriculum
```

### Bad Objection Notes
```
"They said no" ← Useless
"Not interested" ← Tells us nothing
"Already has AI" ← What did they mean?
```

### Objection Categories to Track
- **Budget** - Too expensive, no budget, bad timing
- **Time** - Too busy, can't schedule, agents unavailable
- **Skepticism** - AI doesn't work, tried before, won't help
- **Authority** - Need to ask boss, board decision, corporate
- **Competition** - Already have vendor, using something else
- **Industry** - Market slow, turnover high, agents resistant

---

## Capturing Market Intelligence

Beyond sales data, capture market signals:

### Questions to Ask (When Appropriate)
```
"What are other brokerages in [City] doing with AI?"
"Have you heard of anyone doing training like this?"
"What's the biggest challenge you're all facing right now?"
"Who else should I be talking to in the area?"
```

### Market Intel to Note

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Referral Capture

When they can't buy but might refer:

### Referral Questions
```
"Do you know any other brokerages in [City] who might benefit?"
"Who else is talking about AI training?"
"Any association contacts you could introduce me to?"
```

### Referral Notes
```
Referred by: [Original Lead Name]
Referral: [New Lead Name] at [Company]
Contact: [Phone/Email if given]
Context: "[Original Lead] said they're struggling with same thing"
Follow-up: Mention [Original Lead] when calling
```

## Note-Taking During Calls

### Do's
- **Write while they talk** - Don't rely on memory
- **Use their exact words** - Quotes are powerful
- **Note their tone** - Interested? Skeptical? Rushed?
- **Capture questions** - What they ask = what matters to them

### Don'ts
- **Don't transcribe everything** - Key points only
- **Don't type loudly** - They can hear it
- **Don't let notes distract** - Stay present
- **Don't forget to update** - Do it immediately after

### Shorthand Suggestions
```
VM = Voicemail left
NA = No answer
GK = Gatekeeper
CB = Callback requested
NI = Not interested
BD = Bad data
FU = Follow up
?? = Need to research
```

---

## End of Day Review

Before leaving, review your notes:

### 5-Minute Review Checklist
- [ ] All calls logged with outcome
- [ ] All notes complete (not just "talked")
- [ ] All follow-ups scheduled with dates
- [ ] All bad data flagged
- [ ] Any patterns noticed? (Write them down)

### Weekly Pattern Questions
- Which objection am I hearing most?
- Which region/city is most responsive?
- What's working in my opening?
- What questions are they asking?
- Any new objections to add to the library?

---

## Feedback Loop Integration

4. At end of week: Add to objection library if recurring
```

```
1. Note what worked ("When I said X, they responded well")
2. Note what didn't ("They pushed back when I said Y")
3. At end of week: Update script with learnings
```

### Data Quality Issue?
```
1. Flag the specific issue
2. Note the correct info if available
3. At end of week: Batch corrections to research team
```
