# AI Acceleration Sales System

## The 4 Frameworks You Need (Memorize These)

### 1. PACE (Your Call Structure)
```
P - Pattern Interrupt    "I saw [Hook]..."
A - Ask Permission       "Mind if I ask one question?"
C - Clarify Pain         "What's your biggest bottleneck?"
E - Explain Value        "Here's what we do..."
→ CLOSE:                 "[Day 1] or [Day 2]?"
```

### 2. The $500 Math (Say This Exactly)
```
"If AI saves each agent 5 hours a week,
that's $500 a month per agent.
For 10 agents, that's $60K a year.
The workshop pays for itself month one."
```

### 3. EIR (Handle Any Objection)
```
E - Empathize   "I hear you..."
I - Isolate     "Is it [X] or [Y]?"
R - Reframe     "Here's another way to look at it..."
```

### 4. The 3-3-3 Rule (Daily Activity)
```
3 hours of calls = 40 dials
3 outcomes matter = Connected / VM / Bad Data
3 daily goals = 15 convos, 2 bookings, 5 follow-ups
```

## Quick Start (5 Minutes to First Call)

### 1. Open Your Lead Sheet
The Google Sheet has 500+ leads with:
- **First Name, Last Name**: The decision maker
- **AI Subject Line**: Reference this in your opening
- **AI Opening Hook**: Your pattern interrupt (read it verbatim)
- **Status**: Update after every call

### 2. Your Daily Rhythm
```
8:30 AM   Pull 25 leads marked "Lead" (uncontacted)
9-11 AM   Call Block 1 - Work through list
11 AM     Check Instantly for email openers (hot leads)
1-3 PM    Call Block 2 - Email openers + callbacks
3:30 PM   Update all notes, schedule tomorrow
```

### 3. Your Opening (Word-for-Word)
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.
I sent you an email about [read AI Subject Line].
Did you have a chance to look at it?"
```

If they say NO:
```
"No worries. Quick version: We do one-day AI workshops for
brokerages. Agents leave with systems they use Monday morning.
Worth 2 minutes to explain?"
```

### 4. The Close
```
"I've got availability [dates]. Would [Day 1] or [Day 2] work
better for a 15-minute call to walk through the curriculum?"
```

### 5. After Every Call
Update the sheet:
- **Status**: Lead → Contacted → Booked → Closed
- **Call Notes**: What they said, objections, pain points
- **Follow Up Date**: If scheduling callback
