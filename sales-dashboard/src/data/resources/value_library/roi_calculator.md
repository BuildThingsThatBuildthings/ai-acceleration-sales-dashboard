## The $500/Agent/Month Calculation

### Step by Step
```
Average agent works: 40-60 hours/week
Admin time (listings, emails, social, reports): 5-10 hours/week
AI automation potential: 80% of admin tasks

Time saved: 5 hours × 80% = 4 hours/week
Agent hourly value: $125/hour (based on commission potential)
Monthly savings: 4 hours × 4 weeks × $125 = $2,000/month

Conservative estimate: $500/month per agent
(Using 25% of theoretical savings to be credible)
```

### Why $500 is Conservative
- Assumes only 25% of theoretical savings realized
- Doesn't count quality improvements (better listings, faster responses)
- Doesn't count new business from improved marketing
- Doesn't count reduced errors and rework

## Team ROI by Size

Use this table during calls:

| Team Size | Monthly Value | Annual Value | Workshop Cost | ROI |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| 5 agents | $2,500 | $30,000 | $5,000 | 6:1 |
| 10 agents | $5,000 | $60,000 | $5,000 | 12:1 |
| 15 agents | $7,500 | $90,000 | $5,000 | 18:1 |
| 20 agents | $10,000 | $120,000 | $5,000 | 24:1 |
| 50 agents | $25,000 | $300,000 | $5,000+ | 60:1 |

### Per-Agent Cost
```
$5,000 workshop ÷ 10 agents = $500/agent
$5,000 workshop ÷ 20 agents = $250/agent
```

### Payback Period
```
Monthly value: $5,000 (10-agent team)
Workshop cost: $5,000
Payback: 1 month
```

## Alternative ROI Frames

### Frame 1: Time Recovery
```
"Each agent saves 4-5 hours per week.
That's 200+ hours per agent per year.
For a 10-agent team? 2,000+ hours recovered.

What would your agents do with 2,000 extra hours?"
```

### Frame 2: One Extra Deal
```
"One extra deal per agent per year.
Average commission: $10,000+
For 10 agents: $100,000 in additional revenue.

The workshop is $5,000. One deal pays for it 2x over.
And we're talking 5-10 hours saved EVERY WEEK."
```

### Frame 3: Lead Response Time
```
"Speed to lead = deal or no deal.
Agents who respond in 5 minutes win 8x more often.
AI helps them respond in 2 minutes.

How many deals are you losing to slow follow-up?"
```

### Frame 4: Training Comparison
```
"Compare to any other training:
- CE course: $100-300, minimal practical value
- Conference: $1,000-2,000, mostly networking
- Certification: $500-1,000, theory-heavy

Our workshop: $500/agent, hands-on, immediate use.
Better ROI than anything else you'll invest in."

## Specific Task Savings

Use these when they mention specific pain points:

### Listing Descriptions
```
Before: 40 minutes per listing
After: 10 minutes per listing
Savings: 30 minutes × 4 listings/week = 2 hours/week
Monthly value: 8 hours × $125 = $1,000/agent
```

### Follow-Up Emails
```
Before: 90 minutes/day on routine email
After: 30 minutes/day
Savings: 60 minutes × 5 days = 5 hours/week
Monthly value: 20 hours × $125 = $2,500/agent
```

### Social Media Content
```
Before: 60 minutes/day creating posts
After: 20 minutes/day (batch in 30 min for whole week)
Savings: 40 minutes × 5 days = 3.3 hours/week
Monthly value: 13 hours × $125 = $1,625/agent
```

### Market Reports
```
Before: 45 minutes per report
After: 10 minutes per report
Savings: 35 minutes × 4 reports/month = 2.3 hours/month
Monthly value: 2.3 hours × $125 = $290/agent
```

### Lead Qualification
```
Before: 60 minutes/day triaging leads
After: 20 minutes/day
Savings: 40 minutes × 5 days = 3.3 hours/week
Monthly value: 13 hours × $125 = $1,625/agent
```

## Handling Price Pushback with Math

### "That's expensive"
```
"Let's break it down.

For a 10-agent team, that's $500 per agent.
Each agent saves 4 hours/week minimum.
At $125/hour, that's $500/month in recovered time.

So: $500 investment, $500/month return.
First month pays for itself.
Everything after that is profit."
```

### "We don't have budget"
```
"What if it paid for itself?

Workshop: $5,000
Agent value recovered per month: $5,000+
Payback: Month 1

You're not spending money—you're recovering it."
```

### "Can you prove it?"
```
"Here's what I can prove:

1. Your agents spend 5-10 hours/week on admin
2. AI can automate 80% of that
3. That math = 4 hours/week saved minimum

The only question is: what's 4 hours of your agents'
time worth to you?"
```

## Vendor Sponsor ROI

When using the vendor sponsor angle:

```
Typical sponsor contribution: $1,000-2,000
Your cost after sponsor: $3,000-4,000

Sponsor ROI for THEM:
- 6 hours of face time with [10] agents
- Brand visibility at training
- Positioning as innovation partner
- Cost per agent contact: $100-200
  (Cheaper than any event sponsorship)

Win-win: You get training cheaper,
sponsors get qualified face time.
```

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Team (5 agents)
```
Prospect: "We only have 5 agents."

You: "Perfect. That's $1,000 per agent.
Annual value? $30,000 in recovered time.
6:1 ROI. And your small team can adopt fast—
no bureaucracy, immediate implementation."
```

### Scenario 2: Large Team (50 agents)
```
Prospect: "We have 50 agents."

You: "Fantastic. That's $100 per agent
if we train everyone in one session.
Annual value? $300,000 in recovered productivity.
We can do multiple sessions or train-the-trainer.
What works best for your structure?"
```

### Scenario 3: Budget Constrained
```
Prospect: "We can't afford $5,000 right now."

You: "I understand. Let me show you the math:
Your agents are losing 5-10 hours/week to admin.
At $125/hour, that's $2,500-5,000 per agent per month.

The workshop RECOVERS that time.
You're not spending $5,000—
you're recovering $60,000/year."
```

## The Closing Line

After walking through ROI math, close with:

```
"The math is simple: $5,000 in, $60,000 back.
The only question is whether your team is ready.
What would need to be true for this to work for you?"
```
