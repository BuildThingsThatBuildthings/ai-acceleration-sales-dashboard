AI Acceleration: AI Tools for Real Estate Professionals — Summary Syllabus

Presented to: Williamson County Association of REALTORS® (WCAR)

Duration: 9 to 4

Level: Wide (tailored to attendee experience)

Instructor: Ryan — Founder & CEO, Build Things that Build Things

Devices: Laptops recommended (optional)

Course Summary

A practical ramp-up for REALTORS® on how to think about AI, where it adds value, and how to communicate with it for useful, safe outputs. We cover simple mental models, what AI is (and isn’t), prompting fundamentals, context engineering (feeding the right info and voice), identifying organizational jobs AI can replace or augment, choosing tools without overwhelm, AI fraud awareness (text, voice, image, and document manipulation), and using a desktop AI app with connectors to work faster with screenshots and files.

Learning Outcomes

Participants will be able to:

Explain in plain language what AI is and where it fits in real-estate workflows.

Ask for and iterate on outputs to reach useful drafts quickly.

Use context engineering to reflect brand voice, objections handling, and local nuance.

Identify and prioritize jobs across the organization that AI can replace or meaningfully augment.

Select AI tools by job-to-be-done (small, effective stack).

Apply basic AI fraud awareness across text, voice, images, and documents.

Use a desktop AI app with connectors to summarize files, extract details, and speed communication.

Modules (Sequence)
Opening Q&A: Baseline & Goals

Surface attendee needs; establish a simple priority list for demos and discussion.

Mental Models for AI

First-principles thinking, trust-but-verify, context over cleverness, scaling your best people, and small iterations.

What AI Is / What It’s Good At / What It’s Not

Word engine (not a truth engine); strong fits (drafts, rewrites, summaries, variations); weak fits without provided facts or judgment.

Prompting Fundamentals

Clear asks, audience and channel, essential facts, style constraints, exclusions; quick iteration phrases and formatting.

Context Engineering

Feeding AI the specifics you already know: voice/tone, do/don’t say, objections→responses, local edge, and a simple meta-prompt when stuck.

Identify Top Jobs AI Can Replace or Augment (Thinking Exercise)

Org-wide scan beyond marketing: lead intake/triage, appointment setting, CRM hygiene, transaction micro-tasks, market-intel distillation, customer-service language, FAQs/knowledge surfacing, ops coordination, simple comp/listing scans; selection criteria for pilots.

Finding AI Tools (Keep the Stack Tiny)

Choose by job-to-be-done (text, light images, utilities). Filters: saves minutes now, easy to edit, privacy posture, cost clarity, integrates with current workflow.

Basic AI Security: Fraud Awareness

Practical checks for text (phishing/impersonation), voice (cloning), images (staging/“repairs,” address swaps), and documents (tampering). Verify via known channels; request originals where needed; label enhancements/staging clearly.

Desktop AI Apps + Connectors (MCP-Style, Plain English)

Quick-open app that reads screenshots/PDFs/photos/short audio notes; examples: summarize market PDFs, extract features from photos, condense long threads, turn voice notes into follow-ups.

Materials Provided (Digital)
Prompting checklist and quick iteration guide.

Voice & tactics “context card” template.

Job-replacement scan worksheet (with selection criteria).

AI fraud awareness one-pager (text/voice/image/doc checks).

Tool-selection cheat sheet (job-to-be-done + practical filters).

Desktop AI quick-use card (hotkey, file drop, example commands).

Room & Logistics
Projector/screen with internet and basic audio; whiteboard/markers.

Seating: classroom or conference style.

Laptops recommended (optional).
