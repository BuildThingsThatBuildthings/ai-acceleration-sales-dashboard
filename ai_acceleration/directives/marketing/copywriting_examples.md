# Copywriting Examples & Context

## Tone & Style
- **Casual & Natural:** Write as if you are texting a colleague. Avoid "marketing speak."
- **Direct:** Get to the point immediately.
- **Researched:** Show, don't just tell, that you know who they are.

## "Casualization" Examples
| Raw Company Name | Casualized Version | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Keller Williams Realty, Inc. | Keller Williams | Drops legal suffix |
| Re/Max Fine Properties | Re/Max | Drops specific branch name |
| Coldwell Banker Global Luxury | Coldwell Banker | Drops sub-brand unless relevant |
| Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices | Berkshire Hathaway | Shortens for flow |
| The Ryan Wanner Team at eXp | eXp (or "your team") | Focuses on the main entity |

## Hook Examples
- **Listing Based:** "Loved the staging on that craftsman you listed in Franklin."
- **Award Based:** "Saw the news about the President's Club award—huge congrats."
- **Content Based:** "Just read your post about interest rates, totally agree with your take."

### Template 1: The "Soft Ask"
Subject: quick question

Hi {{firstName}},

Curious if you're using any AI tools to help with the listing descriptions for properties like that?

We're building something specifically for WCAR members to save time on that exact workflow.

Worth a quick chat?

Subject: resource for {{companyName}}

Put together a quick guide on avoiding wire fraud (saw it's spiking in TN). Thought it might be useful for the team at {{companyName}}.

Mind if I send it over?
