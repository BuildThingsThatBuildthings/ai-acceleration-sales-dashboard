**What You're Building**: A "Capstone Pack" with 5 components:
1. Reusable Prompt File
2. Context Card (or relevant excerpt)
3. Two Sample Inputs
4. Two Verified Outputs
5. Measurement Plan

**Why This Matters**: This isn't homework. This is your Monday morning playbook.

## Component 1: Reusable Prompt File (8 minutes)

### Your Task
Create a prompt template that works for EVERY instance of your pilot job, not just one example.

### Requirements

**Structure**:
```
You are my [ROLE] assistant.

TASK: [Clear description of what AI should do]

CONTEXT:
[Paste relevant section of your Voice & Tactics Card]

FACTS (non-negotiable):
[Placeholders for variable information - marked with [BRACKETS]]

STYLE: [Tone, length, format requirements]

EXCLUDE: [Do-not-say items, compliance risks, taboo phrases]

DELIVERABLE: [Specific output format]

VERIFICATION: [Fact-check requirement - AI lists facts used]
```

### Example - Listing Description Prompt

```
You are my real estate copywriting assistant.

TASK: Write a 120-150 word MLS listing description for [PROPERTY ADDRESS] targeting [BUYER PERSONA].

CONTEXT:
- Voice: Warm but professional, educational without jargon
- Tone: Conversational, uses "you" language
- Local storytelling: I grew up in Williamson County
- Taboo: Never use "perfect for families," "safe," "luxury" (unless justified), "master bedroom"
- Compliance: No demographic descriptors, no unverifiable claims

FACTS (non-negotiable):
- Beds: [NUMBER]
- Baths: [NUMBER]
- Square Feet: [NUMBER]
- Lot Size: [NUMBER]
- Key Features: [LIST 3-5 FEATURES]
- Recent Updates: [YEAR AND WHAT]
- School: [SCHOOL NAME + RATING + DISTANCE]
- Commute: [MINUTES TO DOWNTOWN/MAJOR AREA]
- HOA: [AMOUNT/YEAR OR "NONE"]

STYLE: 120-150 words, 2 short paragraphs, conversational but professional

EXCLUDE: Superlatives unless factually supported, demographic descriptors, steering language

DELIVERABLE: MLS-ready description ending with neutral CTA: "Schedule your showing today."

VERIFICATION: At end, list the 3 most important facts you used in [FACT CHECK] brackets so I can verify.
```

## Component 3: Two Sample Inputs (5 minutes)

### Your Task
Create two realistic examples of what you'd paste/upload into AI when doing this job.

### Requirements

**Input A: Typical Scenario** (the common case)
- Example: Standard 3-bed/2-bath single-family home for listing description
- Example: Average lead inquiry for lead triage
- Example: Monthly market update for client email

**Input B: Complex Scenario** (edge case or harder example)
- Example: Unique property (barn conversion, multi-gen home) for listing description
- Example: Vague/unqualified lead for lead triage
- Example: Market decline news requiring sensitive communication

**Why Two Inputs?**: Demonstrates your system handles variety, not just perfect cases.

### Example - Listing Description Inputs

**Input A (Typical)**:
```
Property: 123 Oak Street, Franklin, TN
Beds: 3
Baths: 2
Sqft: 1,850
Lot: 0.4 acres

- Write typical example for your pilot job
- Include all facts AI needs to generate quality output

**Step 2: Create Input B** (2 min)
- Write complex/edge case example
- Show your system handles variety

**Step 3: Label Clearly** (1 min)
- Mark "INPUT A - Typical Scenario"
- Mark "INPUT B - Complex Scenario"

**Success Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Input A is realistic and complete
- [ ] Input B demonstrates system flexibility
- [ ] Both inputs have all necessary facts for AI to succeed
- [ ] Inputs represent variety you'll encounter in real work

---

## Component 4: Two Verified Outputs (8 minutes)

### Your Task
Generate AI outputs using your prompt + inputs, then review and edit to demonstrate quality control.

### Requirements

**For Each Input (A and B)**:
1. Run your prompt with that input
2. Review AI output critically
3. Verify facts (check against input)
4. Edit for accuracy, tone, compliance
5. Annotate what you changed and why

### Process

**Step 1: Generate Output A** (2 min)
- Use Prompt File (Component 1) + Input A (Component 3)
- Run in your AI tool
- Copy raw output

**Step 2: Verify & Edit Output A** (2 min)
- Check: Do facts match input? (beds, baths, sqft, school)
- Check: Is tone right? (matches your voice pillars)
- Check: Any compliance issues? (Fair Housing violations, superlatives)
- Check: Length correct? (meets word count constraint)
- Edit as needed

**Step 3: Annotate Changes** (1 min)
- Mark edits in [BRACKETS] or highlight
- Note why you changed it

**Example Annotation**:
```
ORIGINAL OUTPUT:
"This charming home is perfect for families with its spacious backyard and top-rated school."

EDITED OUTPUT:
"This well-maintained home [removed 'charming' - subjective] features a fenced backyard and sits 0.6 miles from Liberty Elementary (8/10 rating). [removed 'perfect for families' - Fair Housing risk, added specific school detail]"

WHY EDITED: Removed Fair Housing risk ("perfect for families"), removed unverifiable claim ("charming"), added specific factual detail (school distance).
```

**Step 4: Repeat for Output B** (3 min)
- Generate, verify, edit, annotate

**Success Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Output A generated, verified, edited, annotated
- [ ] Output B generated, verified, edited, annotated
- [ ] All facts verified against inputs (no hallucinations)
- [ ] Edits are marked and explained
- [ ] Outputs are production-ready (you'd publish them)

## Component 5: Measurement Plan (6 minutes)

### Your Task
Define how you'll measure success and track ROI for this AI system.

### Requirements

Create a simple measurement plan with 5 elements:

**1. Current State**: Time/effort before AI
**2. Target State**: Time/effort with AI
**3. Time Saved**: Quantified difference
**4. Quality Proxy**: How you'll ensure quality doesn't drop
**5. Review Schedule**: When you'll evaluate system performance

### Template

```
MEASUREMENT PLAN: [Pilot Job Name]

CURRENT STATE (Before AI):
- Time per instance: ___ minutes
- Instances per week: ___
- Total time/week: ___ minutes
- Quality issues: [e.g., inconsistent tone, missing facts, slow turnaround]

TARGET STATE (With AI):
- Time per instance: ___ minutes (AI draft + human review)
- Instances per week: ___ (same or more)
- Total time/week: ___ minutes
- Quality improvements: [e.g., consistent voice, zero Fair Housing violations, faster delivery]

TIME SAVED:
- Per instance: ___ minutes
- Per week: ___ minutes
- Per year: ___ hours (weekly × 50 weeks)

QUALITY PROXY (How I'll ensure quality):
- [ ] Fact-check every output against [SOURCE]
- [ ] Peer review: [colleague] spot-checks 1 output/week
- [ ] Client feedback: Track complaints/revisions
- [ ] Compliance review: Zero Fair Housing violations in 20 outputs
- [ ] Self-audit: Review 5 outputs monthly, score 1-10 quality

REVIEW SCHEDULE:
- Week 1: Daily check - is system working as expected?
- Week 2: Measure actual time saved vs. estimate
- Week 4: Quality audit - review 10 outputs for accuracy + compliance
- Month 3: ROI decision - keep, modify, or stop system

SUCCESS CRITERIA (I'll consider this system successful if):
- Saves ≥[X] minutes per week
- Quality scores 7+/10 on self-audits
- Zero major errors (e.g., Fair Housing violation, factual misrepresentation)
- I'm still using it consistently after 30 days
```

### Your Turn

**Step 1: Quantify Current State** (2 min)
- How long does this job take now? (Be honest)
- How often do you do it?
- What quality issues exist?

**Step 2: Project Target State** (2 min)
- How long will it take with AI? (Draft time + review time)
- Will you do it more often because it's faster?
- What quality improvements do you expect?

**Step 3: Calculate Time Saved** (1 min)
- Simple math: (Current time - Target time) × Instances per week

**Step 4: Define Quality Proxy** (1 min)
- Pick 2-3 checkpoints from template list
- Add any job-specific checks

**Step 5: Set Review Schedule** (30 sec)
- When will you check if this is working?

**Success Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Current state quantified (time, frequency)
- [ ] Target state projected (time, frequency)
- [ ] Time saved calculated (per week, per year)
- [ ] Quality proxy defined (at least 2 checkpoints)
- [ ] Review schedule set (week 1, 2, 4, month 3)

## Facilitation Notes

### Setup (Before Exercise)
- Distribute Capstone Pack Template folders (digital link or printed packets)
- Have rubric handouts ready
- Display timer on screen (visible countdown from 30 min)
- Write component checklist on whiteboard:
  - [ ] Prompt File
  - [ ] Context Card
  - [ ] Sample Inputs
  - [ ] Verified Outputs
  - [ ] Measurement Plan
- Prepare example capstone pack to show

### While Facilitating

**0-2 min: Framing**
- "This is your Monday morning playbook. Build something you'll actually use."
- "You have 30 minutes. Use your Job Scan worksheet - pick one pilot job."
- Display example capstone pack briefly

**2-10 min: Prompt File**
- Announce: "Component 1 - Reusable Prompt. Use the template structure provided."
- At 5 min: "Halfway - you should have TASK, CONTEXT, FACTS sections done"
- At 8 min: "Test your prompt - run it once to see if it works"
- At 10 min: "Move to Component 2"

**10-13 min: Context Card**
- Announce: "Component 2 - Context Card. Copy your card from Module 6 or relevant excerpt."
- Quick task - most will finish in 2 min

**13-18 min: Sample Inputs**
- Announce: "Component 3 - Two sample inputs. Typical and complex scenarios."
- At 15 min: "You should be writing Input B (complex) now"

**18-26 min: Verified Outputs**
- Announce: "Component 4 - Generate outputs, verify, edit, annotate. This is the longest section."
- At 20 min: "You should be running AI on Input A now"
- At 23 min: "Finish Output A, move to Output B"
- At 26 min: "Wrap up outputs - move to final component"

**26-30 min: Measurement Plan**
- Announce: "Component 5 - Measurement plan. Quantify time saved and quality checks."
- At 28 min: "Fill in current state, target state, time saved"
- At 30 min: "Time. Finish your review schedule if not done."

**30-32 min: Self-Assessment**
- "Score yourself using the rubric. 7+ points = production-ready."
- "If below 7, note what needs work. You can refine after workshop."

### Circulating During Work Time

**Look for**:
- Participants stuck on pilot job selection → "Go with gut - pick the one that excites you most"
- Prompts too vague → "Add constraints - length, tone, exclusions"
- Skipping verification → "Stop - verify facts in Output A before moving to B"
- Rushing measurement plan → "This is how you prove ROI - don't skip it"

**Provide Real-Time Feedback**:
- Glance at screens, offer quick tips: "Great prompt structure" or "Add a verification checkpoint"
- Answer questions while walking room

### Debrief Questions (2-3 min, Module 13)
- "Who built something they're excited to use Monday?"
- "What was hardest part of capstone?"
- "What's your time-saved estimate - raise hand if 30+ min/week"
- "Who will share their capstone with a colleague this week?"

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "I can't decide which pilot job to build"
**Solution**: "Flip a coin. Both are good choices. Build one now, build second later this week."

**Issue**: "My prompt isn't working - AI output is bad"
**Solution**: "Check: Did you provide enough facts? Add context from your Context Card. Try again."

**Issue**: "I don't have time to finish all 5 components"
**Solution**: "Prioritize: Prompt + Outputs (Components 1, 4) are core. Finish others after workshop."

**Issue**: "I finished early - what now?"
**Solution**: "Start building your second pilot job system. Or refine your first system - make it even better."

**Issue**: "I don't know how to quantify time saved"
**Solution**: "Rough estimate is fine. Track actual time next week to validate."

- Simplification: Reduce outputs from 2 to 1 (skip complex scenario)
- Simplification: Provide sample measurement plan to customize
- Support: Pair with experienced participant, collaborate on one capstone

### Time Adjustments
**If running 10 minutes behind**:
- Reduce outputs from 2 to 1 (Component 4)
- Make measurement plan optional (focus on prompt + outputs)
- Extend capstone time by 10 min (cut Module 13 wrap-up slightly)

**If running 10 minutes ahead**:
- Add Component 6: "Rollout plan" (how will you train team to use this?)
- Peer review: Swap capstones with neighbor, provide feedback
- Start implementation: Send first real output to client/colleague

---

## Follow-Up

### Connection to Handouts
