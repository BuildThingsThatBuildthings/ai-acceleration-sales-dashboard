# Exercise: Fraud Demos

## Overview
**Purpose**: Recognize AI-generated fraud across 4 attack vectors and establish verification protocols
**Module**: Module 10 - AI Security & Fraud Awareness (2:10-2:40 PM)
**Time**: 30 minutes (20 min demos + 10 min protocol creation)
**Format**: Instructor-led demos with participant analysis and discussion
**Materials Needed**:
- 4 pre-prepared fraud examples (text, voice, image, document)
- Fraud Detection Checklist handout
- Projector/screen for displaying examples
- Audio playback for voice demo
- Smartphones (participants use for verification protocol practice)

## Learning Objectives
By completing this exercise, participants will be able to:
- Identify 4 types of AI-generated fraud: text, voice, image, document
- Spot red flags in each attack vector
- Apply verification protocols (verify via known channel, never via reply/callback number)
- Create a personal "fraud SOP" to follow for suspicious communications
- Understand why wire fraud is the #1 risk in real estate transactions
- Feel confident catching AI-generated fakes

---

## Instructions for Participants

### Context: Why This Matters in Real Estate

**Real-World Statistics**:
- Wire fraud attempts targeting real estate transactions increased 300%+ since 2020
- Average loss per successful wire fraud: $150,000
- AI voice cloning can replicate anyone's voice from 3-10 seconds of audio
- AI can generate convincing fake documents, emails, and images in minutes

**Your Exposure**:
- You handle wire transfers (down payments, earnest money, closing funds)
- You receive "urgent" requests from title officers, lenders, clients
- You share property photos that can be manipulated
- You sign documents via email/DocuSign

**The Stakes**: One missed fake email can cost your client their life savings and end your career.

## Demo 1: Text/Email Fraud (5 minutes)

### Instructor Presents: Phishing Email

**Display this email on screen:**

```
From: jennifer.martinez@wilsontitle.com
To: [Your Email]
Subject: URGENT - Wire Instructions Change for 456 Oak Street Closing

Hi [Agent Name],

We had a last-minute issue with the original account. Please use the updated wire instructions below for the buyer's closing funds ($85,000) due by EOD Thursday.

NEW WIRE INSTRUCTIONS:
Bank: First National Trust
Routing: 062005690
Account: 8472951034
Account Name: Wilson Title Escrow

This is time-sensitive - the seller is threatening to back out if funds aren't received by 5pm. Please confirm you received this and will send to your buyer immediately.

Thanks,
Jennifer Martinez
Senior Escrow Officer
Wilson County Title Company
615-555-0147
```

### Participant Task: Spot the Red Flags (2 minutes)

**Your Job**: Identify what's suspicious about this email. Write down at least 3 red flags.

**Red Flags to Find**:
1. ❌ **Urgency pressure**: "time-sensitive," "seller threatening to back out"
2. ❌ **Unsolicited wire change**: Legitimate title companies NEVER send new instructions via email alone
3. ❌ **Domain mismatch**: "wilsontitle.com" vs actual domain might be "wilsoncountytitle.com" (subtle typo)
4. ❌ **Request to bypass normal process**: "send to your buyer immediately" (no verification step)
5. ❌ **Generic greeting**: Could be more personalized if real relationship exists
6. ❌ **No context**: No reference to previous communications or transaction number

### Verification Protocol (What You Should Do):

**DO**:
- ✅ Call Jennifer at the ORIGINAL number you have saved (NOT the number in email)
- ✅ Ask for transaction number and verify details over phone
- ✅ Request signed letter on company letterhead confirming wire change
- ✅ Verify with your broker before forwarding anything to client

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Reply to this email
- ❌ Call the number in the email signature
- ❌ Forward to client without verification
- ❌ Assume urgency = legitimacy

---

## Demo 2: Voice Fraud (5 minutes)

### Instructor Presents: Cloned Voice Message

**Play this voicemail** (instructor pre-records using AI voice cloning or describes scenario):

```
[Voicemail - sounds like your broker's voice, slightly robotic undertone]

"Hey [Agent Name], it's [Broker Name]. I'm in meetings all day but need you to handle something urgent. We have a compliance issue with the Miller transaction - I need you to text me the buyer's full loan application with social security number so I can file with the state by 3pm. This is critical. Text it to this number: 615-555-0192. Don't call, I'm on back-to-back calls. Thanks."
```

### Participant Task: Spot the Red Flags (2 minutes)

**Your Job**: What makes this voicemail suspicious? Write down red flags.

**Red Flags to Find**:
1. ❌ **Unusual request**: Brokers don't ask for SSNs via text (data security risk)
2. ❌ **Urgency + avoidance**: "Don't call me" is suspicious (prevents verification)
3. ❌ **Unfamiliar number**: Callback number different from broker's known cell/office
4. ❌ **Voice anomalies**: May sound slightly flat, robotic, or have odd pacing
5. ❌ **Out-of-process request**: Compliance issues don't get resolved via text message

### Verification Protocol (What You Should Do):

**DO**:
- ✅ Call your broker at their KNOWN cell/office number (saved in your phone)
- ✅ Ask: "Did you just leave me a voicemail about the Miller transaction?"
- ✅ Use code word system if your office has one ("What's our safe word?")
- ✅ Assume voice cloning until proven otherwise

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Call back the number in the voicemail
- ❌ Text sensitive information to unknown numbers
- ❌ Trust voice alone as authentication
- ❌ Act on urgent requests without verification

---

## Demo 3: Image Fraud (5 minutes)

### Instructor Presents: Manipulated Listing Photo

**Display two photos side-by-side** (instructor pre-prepares):
- **Photo A**: Original exterior listing photo (shows worn siding, overgrown landscaping)
- **Photo B**: AI-enhanced version (siding looks pristine, grass is perfect, sky is unnaturally blue)

### Participant Task: Spot the Manipulation (2 minutes)

**Your Job**: Compare the photos. What looks "off" about Photo B?

**Manipulation Indicators**:
1. ❌ **Cloning artifacts**: Grass pattern repeats identically (copy-paste texture)
2. ❌ **Inconsistent lighting**: Shadows don't match sun position in sky
3. ❌ **Unnatural perfection**: Siding has zero texture variation, looks "plastic"
4. ❌ **Sky replacement**: Sky is stock photo (too perfect, lens perspective doesn't match)
5. ❌ **Missing details**: Cracks in driveway "healed," gutter damage disappeared

### Verification Protocol (What You Should Do):

**DO**:
- ✅ Compare listing photos to Google Street View (even if dated)
- ✅ Visit property in person before using photos
- ✅ Disclose: "Photos have been edited for marketing" per MLS rules
- ✅ Use reputable photographers who don't over-edit

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Use AI to "fix" property defects without disclosure
- ❌ Trust listing photos from unknown sources
- ❌ Assume photo = current condition
- ❌ Violate MLS photo editing policies

---

## Demo 4: Document Fraud (5 minutes)

### Instructor Presents: Altered Purchase Agreement Addendum

**Display two addendums** (instructor pre-prepares or describes):
- **Original**: Earnest money due date is "5 business days after acceptance"
- **Altered**: AI-modified version shows "2 business days after acceptance"

**Both look identical**: Same font, same DocuSign signature blocks, same layout.

### Participant Task: Spot the Alteration (2 minutes)

**Your Job**: If you can't see a visual difference, what process would catch this fraud?

**Detection Methods**:
1. ✅ **Compare to original**: Check email thread for original attachment - hash mismatch
2. ✅ **Check DocuSign audit trail**: View certificate of completion (altered docs won't have valid trail)
3. ✅ **Watch for "forwarded" docs**: If client forwards vs. sending DocuSign link, red flag
4. ✅ **Verify via known channel**: Call client at known number: "Did you modify this term?"

**Red Flags**:
1. ❌ **Unexpected changes**: Terms you negotiated are suddenly different
2. ❌ **No tracked changes**: Major edit with no indication of who changed what
3. ❌ **Document source**: Arrives via forwarded email, not direct from DocuSign/title
4. ❌ **Pressure to sign fast**: "Just initial this update so we can move forward"

### Verification Protocol (What You Should Do):

**DO**:
- ✅ Request documents ONLY via trusted channels (DocuSign direct link, title company portal)
- ✅ Verify any changes via phone call with other party + broker
- ✅ Check DocuSign certificate of completion for authenticity
- ✅ Maintain original copies in transaction file for comparison

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Trust forwarded PDF copies of signed documents
- ❌ Accept "quick initial here" requests without reading
- ❌ Assume document is real because it looks real
- ❌ Skip broker review on altered documents

## Part 2: Create Your Fraud SOP (10 minutes)

### Your Task: Document Your Personal Verification Protocol

**Scenario-Based SOP**: For each scenario, write your step-by-step response.

**Template**: "If [TRIGGER], then I will [ACTIONS]."

---

### Scenario 1: Suspicious Email

**IF** I receive an email requesting wire instruction changes, urgent action, or sensitive information:

**THEN I WILL**:
1. ☑️ Stop and do NOT reply or take immediate action
2. ☑️ Check sender email domain against known contact (look for typos: "wilsontitle" vs "wilsoncountytitle")
3. ☑️ Call sender at SAVED number in my phone (NOT number in email signature)
4. ☑️ Verify request using specific transaction details only sender would know
5. ☑️ Alert my broker before proceeding
6. ☑️ If confirmed legit, request signed authorization on letterhead

**Your Customization** (Add office-specific steps):
-
-

---

### Scenario 2: Suspicious Voicemail/Call

**IF** I receive a voicemail or call requesting sensitive data, wire transfers, or urgent action:

**THEN I WILL**:
1. ☑️ Do NOT call back the number from caller ID
2. ☑️ Call sender at their KNOWN number from my saved contacts
3. ☑️ Ask verification question: "What's our [code word/specific detail only they'd know]?"
4. ☑️ If voice sounds "off," say: "I need to verify via video call or in-person"
5. ☑️ Never text sensitive information (SSN, account numbers, passwords)
6. ☑️ Report potential fraud to broker immediately

**Your Customization** (Add office-specific steps):
-
-

---

### Scenario 3: Suspicious Photos/Images

**IF** I receive property photos that look too perfect or inconsistent:

**THEN I WILL**:
1. ☑️ Compare to Google Street View and satellite view
2. ☑️ Request visit to property before using photos in marketing
3. ☑️ Ask photographer/source: "What editing was done?"
4. ☑️ Disclose any enhancements in listing ("virtually staged," "edited for color correction")
5. ☑️ Follow MLS photo editing policies strictly
6. ☑️ When in doubt, re-shoot photos myself or with trusted vendor

**Your Customization** (Add office-specific steps):
-
-

---

### Scenario 4: Suspicious Documents

**IF** I receive a modified contract, addendum, or closing document:

**THEN I WILL**:
1. ☑️ Compare to original in my email thread (check for mismatches)
2. ☑️ Check DocuSign certificate of completion for authenticity
3. ☑️ Call sending party at KNOWN number to verify changes
4. ☑️ Review with broker before signing or forwarding to client
5. ☑️ Request tracked-changes version showing edits
6. ☑️ If any doubt, request re-execution through official channels

**Your Customization** (Add office-specific steps):
-
-

---

### Office-Wide Protocol

**Create a Shared Verification System**:

**Code Word System** (Optional but recommended):
- Establish a verbal code word with your broker, TC, and frequent partners
- If receiving suspicious request, ask: "What's our code word?"
- Fraudsters won't know it

**Your Code Word** (write it here, memorize it, DON'T store in email):
- Code word with broker: _______________
- Code word with TC: _______________

**Reporting Chain**:
- If I suspect fraud, I will notify: _______________
- Within: _______________ (timeframe)
- Via: _______________ (phone/email/Slack)

---

## Facilitation Notes

### Setup (Before Exercise)
- Pre-create all 4 fraud examples (realistic but clearly labeled as demos)
- Test audio playback for voice demo
- Print Fraud Detection Checklist (1 per participant)
- Have QR code ready for reporting fraud resources (FBI IC3, FTC, state real estate commission)
- Prepare "horror story" example (real case study with details changed) to open exercise

### While Facilitating

**Opening (2 min)**:
- Share real fraud statistic or story: "Last year in Tennessee, [X agents/transactions] lost $[Y] to wire fraud"
- Set tone: "This is the scariest part of the day. But awareness = prevention. Let's learn to spot fakes."

**Demo 1 - Text (0-5 min)**:
- Display email on screen
- "Take 2 minutes - write down red flags you see"
- At 2 min: "Call them out - what's suspicious?"
- Capture answers, add any they missed
- Teach verification protocol

**Demo 2 - Voice (5-10 min)**:
- Play voicemail (or describe if can't pre-record)
- "What's wrong here? Write red flags."
- Discuss: "Voice cloning is scary because it sounds REAL"
- Teach verification protocol
- Show example: Pull up ElevenLabs or similar voice cloning tool, demonstrate how easy it is

**Demo 3 - Image (10-15 min)**:
- Show side-by-side photos
- "Photo B looks better - but is it ethical? Legal? What changed?"
- Discuss manipulation indicators
- Key point: "MLS violations + misrepresentation liability"

**Demo 4 - Document (15-20 min)**:
- Show addendums (or describe scenario)
- "How would you catch this if visually identical?"
- Discuss DocuSign audit trails, email thread comparison
- Key point: "When in doubt, verify via known channel"

**SOP Creation (20-30 min)**:
- "Now you create YOUR fraud response plan"
- Display template on screen
- "Fill in each scenario - what will YOU do?"
- At 25 min: "Add your code word and reporting chain"
- At 30 min: "Take photo of your SOP with your phone - save it"

### Debrief Questions (During transition to next module)
- "What fraud type scares you most?"
- "Who will you establish a code word with this week?"
- "Anyone have a near-miss story they can share?"

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "This feels like fear-mongering"
**Solution**: "It's not fear - it's preparedness. Like fire drills. Hope you never need it, but if you do, you're ready."

**Issue**: "I would never fall for this"
**Solution**: "That's what every victim said. Fraudsters are pros. They count on overconfidence."

**Issue**: "My clients will think I'm paranoid if I verify everything"
**Solution**: "Frame it: 'I verify everything for your protection. It's my standard protocol.' They'll respect that."

**Issue**: "What if I verify and it's real and I offended someone?"
**Solution**: "Better safe than sorry. Say: 'I verify all wire changes per my broker's policy.' No one credible will be offended."

---

## Success Criteria

**Individual Success**:
- Correctly identified 8+ red flags across 4 demos (2+ per demo)
- Completed fraud SOP for all 4 scenarios
- Established code word with at least 1 colleague
- Can explain "verify via known channel" protocol
- Feels more confident spotting AI-generated fraud

**Group Success**:
- 100% of participants pass 5/6 on post-exercise quiz (see assessments.md)
- Active discussion during demos (calling out red flags)
- Multiple participants commit to implementing verification protocols
- Shift from "that won't happen to me" to "I need to be vigilant"

**Knowledge Check** (Instructor can do verbally):
1. "If you get an email requesting wire change, what do you do?" → Call sender at saved number
2. "If a voicemail sounds weird, can you trust it?" → No, voice cloning is easy
3. "Can AI-edited photos violate MLS rules?" → Yes, disclosure required
4. "Who's responsible if you forward a fake document?" → You are
