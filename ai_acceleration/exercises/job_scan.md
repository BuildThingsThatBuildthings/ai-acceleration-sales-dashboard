### Part 2: Job Analysis & Quantification (5 minutes)

**Your Task**: For each job you listed, answer these questions in the worksheet.

**Worksheet Columns**:
| Job Description | Current Owner | Current Steps | Time per Instance | Instances per Week | Total Min/Week | Pain Level (1-10) | AI Fit (Strong/Medium/Weak) | Success Metric |

**How to Fill It Out**:

**Current Owner**: Who does this now? (You, assistant, TC, no one consistently)

**Current Steps**: Break down the process (e.g., "Read lead email → Extract info → Look up neighborhood → Draft reply → Send → Log in CRM" = 6 steps)

**Time per Instance**: How long does ONE occurrence take? (Be honest, include distractions)

**Instances per Week**: How often does this job happen?

**Total Min/Week**: Multiply time × instances

**Pain Level (1-10)**: How much does this job frustrate/drain you?
- 1-3 = Mild annoyance
- 4-6 = Moderate pain (boring, repetitive, error-prone)
- 7-10 = Major pain (dreaded task, bottleneck, causing client delays)

**AI Fit**: Use Module 4 mental model:
- **Strong Fit**: AI has the facts, job is drafting/rewriting/summarizing
- **Medium Fit**: AI can help but needs significant human input/verification
- **Weak Fit**: Requires judgment, facts AI doesn't have, relationship skills

**Success Metric**: How will you know AI worked?
- Time saved: "5-minute task becomes 2-minute task"
- Quality: "Zero Fair Housing violations in 10 outputs"
- Volume: "Can process 20 leads/day instead of 10"
- Consistency: "Every listing description has school info included"

**Example Row**:
| Draft listing description | Me | Look at MLS sheet (1 min) → Open AI (30 sec) → Write prompt with details (2 min) → Review output (1 min) → Edit for accuracy (2 min) → Paste to MLS (30 sec) | 7 min | 3 listings/week | 21 min/week | Pain Level: 6 | AI Fit: Strong | Reduced to 4 min per listing (save 9 min/week) |

### Part 3: Pilot Selection & Prioritization (10 minutes)

**Your Task**: Select 2 pilot jobs to implement this week using AI.

**Selection Criteria** (use this framework):

**Must-Have Requirements**:
- [ ] **High impact**: Saves ≥30 minutes per week combined (both pilots together)
- [ ] **Strong or Medium AI fit**: Not a weak fit job
- [ ] **Low risk**: If AI output is wrong, easy to catch/fix before harm
- [ ] **Repeatable**: Happens at least weekly, not one-off project
- [ ] **You control it**: Not dependent on someone else's workflow

**Nice-to-Have Factors**:
- [ ] High pain level (7+) - tackling your biggest frustration
- [ ] Quick win potential - results visible in 1-2 days
- [ ] Scales to team - if it works for you, others can use it

**The Dot-Vote Method** (Visual Prioritization):
1. Review your full job list
2. Put 3 GREEN dots on jobs that meet all must-haves
3. Put 1 RED dot on jobs that are high-risk or weak AI fit
4. Circle the 2 jobs with most green dots and fewest red dots
5. Those are your pilots

**Write Your 2 Pilot Selections**:

**Pilot Job #1**:
- Job:
- Current time/week:
- Expected time/week with AI:
- Time saved:
- AI fit:
- Risk level (Low/Medium/High):
- Success metric:
- First action step: (e.g., "Create prompt using context card by EOD today")

**Pilot Job #2**:
- Job:
- Current time/week:
- Expected time/week with AI:
- Time saved:
- AI fit:
- Risk level (Low/Medium/High):
- Success metric:
- First action step:

**Commitment**: I will implement Pilot #1 by [DATE] and Pilot #2 by [DATE].

## Facilitation Notes

### Setup (Before Exercise)
- Print Job Scan Worksheets (1 per participant) or share digital template
- Have blank worksheets projected on screen as example
- Prepare timer (will use visible countdown for each domain)
- Have colored dot stickers ready for prioritization
- Write domain list on whiteboard for reference

### While Facilitating

**Part 1: Domain Inventory (0-20 min)**
- Announce: "We're going domain by domain. I'll call time after each one. Write fast, don't overthink."
- For EACH domain (8 domains × 2-3 min each):
  - Display domain name and prompt questions
  - "You have 3 minutes - list every job in this domain. Go."
  - Walk room, glance at worksheets, prompt stuck participants: "What about [example job]?"
  - At time: "Pencils down, moving to next domain"
- At 10-min mark: "Halfway done. You should have 15-20 jobs listed by now."
- At 20-min mark: "Domain scan complete. Count your jobs - how many total? Should be 20-40."

**Part 2: Job Analysis (20-25 min)**
- Announce: "Now quantify. For each job, estimate time per week and pain level. Use worksheet columns."
- At 22 min: "Focus on time calculations - this is data that drives decisions"
- At 25 min: "Finish up. You don't need every job analyzed, just top 10-15."

**Part 3: Pilot Selection (25-35 min)**
- Announce: "Final step - pick your 2 pilots. Use the must-have criteria. Green dots for strong candidates, red dots for risky ones."
- At 28 min: "You should be dot-voting now"
- At 30 min: "Circle your top 2. Write them in the pilot section with success metrics."
- At 33 min: "Write your first action step for each pilot. Make it specific."
- At 35 min: "Pencils down. You have your pilots."

### Debrief Questions (2 minutes)
- "How many jobs did you discover that you didn't realize consumed time?"
- "Show of hands: Who has 2 pilots that could save 30+ min/week?"
- "What surprised you about where your time goes?"
- "Anyone pick a pilot they're excited about? What is it?"

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "I don't do that many repeatable jobs - every client is different"
**Solution**: "Look for patterns. You may customize content, but the PROCESS repeats. 'Draft follow-up email' is a job even if every email is unique."

**Issue**: "I have no idea how long things take"
**Solution**: "Best guess is fine. Track one instance this week to validate. Estimates are better than nothing."

**Issue**: "Everything is high pain - how do I choose?"
**Solution**: "Start with highest time + lowest risk. Win fast, build confidence, then tackle harder jobs."

**Issue**: "My pilots won't save 30 min/week"
**Solution**: "Then pick 3 smaller pilots instead of 2. Or pick a bigger job. The goal is meaningful time back."

**Issue**: "I want to automate [complex strategic task]"
**Solution**: "That's medium fit at best. Start with a strong fit pilot to build skills, then level up."

## Success Criteria

**Individual Success**:
- Identified 20+ jobs across domains
- Quantified time/week for top 10-15 jobs
- Selected 2 pilots that meet all must-have criteria (≥30 min saved, strong fit, low risk, repeatable)
- Defined measurable success metrics for both pilots
- Written specific first action step for each pilot
- Feels confident about pilot feasibility

**Group Success**:
- 90%+ of participants have 2 valid pilots selected
- Total time savings across room = 10+ hours/week combined
- Pilot variety (not everyone picking same job - shows personalization)
- Energy shift from "I don't know what to automate" to "I have a clear plan"

**Red Flags** (Intervene):
- Participant selects weak AI fit jobs (relationship-building, negotiation, strategy)
- Pilots are too vague ("use AI more")
- No time quantification (can't measure success)
- High-risk pilots chosen (compliance-sensitive, client-facing without review)

## Variations

### For Advanced Participants
- Challenge: Document full workflow for each pilot job (create SOP)
- Challenge: Identify 5 pilots instead of 2, rank by ROI
- Challenge: Calculate annual time savings and dollar value (hours × hourly rate)

### For Beginners
- Simplification: Pre-populate worksheet with 20 common real estate jobs, they select from list
- Simplification: Reduce domains from 8 to 5 (focus on lead intake, listing prep, client communication, market analysis, follow-up)
- Support: Pair with experienced participant to brainstorm jobs

### Time Adjustments
**If running 10 minutes behind**:
- Reduce domain time to 2 min each (16 min total for Part 1)
- Make job analysis optional (pick pilots based on gut + time estimates only)
- Reduce pilot selection to 5 min (quick decision)

**If running 5 minutes ahead**:
- Add Part 4: "Tool Selection" (which tool will you use for each pilot?)
- Extended discussion: Pair-share pilots and get peer feedback

---

## Follow-Up

### Connection to Handouts
- **Job Scan Worksheet**: Participants keep this as their implementation roadmap
- **Tool Selection Cheatsheet** (Module 9): Will use pilots from this exercise to choose tools

### Connection to Next Activities
- **Module 9 (Tool Selection)**: "You have 2 pilots. Next we'll choose the right tool for each job."
- **Capstone Sprint (Module 12)**: "Pick ONE of your 2 pilots for capstone project."

### Post-Workshop Actions
- Test Pilot #1 within 48 hours (implement prompt, run 3 times, measure time)
- Log actual time saved vs. estimated (validate assumptions)
- Report results in 7-day check-in email
- If pilot succeeds, train team member to use it (scale impact)
