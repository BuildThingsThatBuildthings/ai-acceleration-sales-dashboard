## Instructions for Participants

### What is a Context Card?

A Context Card is a **one-page document** you paste at the beginning of any AI prompt to instantly improve quality. Think of it as:
- Your brand voice guide
- Your objection-handling cheat sheet
- Your local expertise distilled
- Your compliance guardrails

**How You'll Use It**: Copy/paste the relevant section into any prompt, and AI will match your style and handle common scenarios automatically.

### Template Section 1: Voice Pillars (5 minutes)

**Your Task**: Define how you sound in client communications.

**Answer These Questions**:
1. What 3 words describe your communication style? (e.g., warm, direct, educational)
2. Are you formal or conversational?
3. Do you use humor, or keep it strictly professional?
4. What makes your voice unique compared to other agents?

**Example - Agent Sarah**:
```
VOICE PILLARS:
- Warm but professional
- Educational without being condescending
- Conversational, uses "you" language
- Avoids real estate jargon
- Uses local storytelling (grew up in Williamson County)
```

**Your Turn** - Write your 3-5 voice pillars:
```
VOICE PILLARS:
-

-
-
```

### Template Section 2: Taboo Phrases (3 minutes)

**Your Task**: List words/phrases you NEVER use (for compliance, brand, or personal reasons).

**Why This Matters**: AI loves clichés and risky language. Pre-emptively ban it.

**Common Real Estate Taboos** (add your own):
- "Perfect for families" (Fair Housing risk - familial status)
- "Safe neighborhood" (Fair Housing risk - steering)
- "Master bedroom" (outdated terminology, use "primary bedroom")
- "Luxury" (unless truly justified by comps)
- "You won't believe..." (clickbait tone)
- "Cozy" (code for small - be honest about size)

**Your Turn** - List 5-10 phrases you never want AI to use:
```
TABOO PHRASES (Never Use):
-
-
-
-
-
-
```

---

### Template Section 3: Call-to-Action Hierarchy (5 minutes)

**Your Task**: Define your standard CTAs for different situations.

**Why This Matters**: AI needs to know how you prefer to close communications.

**Fill In Your Preferred CTAs**:

**For Listings/Marketing**:
- Primary CTA: (e.g., "Schedule a showing via my website")
- Secondary CTA: (e.g., "Text me at [number] with questions")
- Soft CTA: (e.g., "See full details at [link]")

**For Lead Follow-Up**:
- Primary CTA: (e.g., "Let's schedule a 15-minute call - here are 3 times that work")
- Secondary CTA: (e.g., "Reply with your availability this week")
- Soft CTA: (e.g., "Feel free to reach out if you have questions")

**For Objection Handling**:
- Primary CTA: (e.g., "Let's discuss this on a quick call - how about [day] at [time]?")
- Secondary CTA: (e.g., "I'll send over data that addresses this - expect an email by EOD")

**Your Turn** - Write your CTA preferences:
```
MY CALL-TO-ACTION PREFERENCES:
Listing/Marketing:
Lead Follow-Up:
Objection Handling:
```

### Template Section 4: Top 10 Objections + One-Line Rebuttals (12 minutes)

**Your Task**: Document the objections you hear repeatedly and your proven responses.

**Why This Matters**: AI can generate objection-handling language, but only YOU know what actually works with your clients.

**Common Real Estate Objections** (customize these):

1. **"The Zillow Zestimate says it's worth more"**
   - Rebuttal: "Zestimates use broad data; my CMA uses recent neighborhood sales and property condition. Let's compare both."

2. **"I want to wait for interest rates to drop"**
   - Rebuttal: "Rates matter, but so does price. When rates drop, buyer competition increases and prices rise. Let's run the math on both scenarios."

3. **"Can I just list it myself (FSBO)?"**
   - Rebuttal: "You can, but consider: I handle marketing, showings, negotiations, paperwork, and have buyer access you don't. Most FSBOs convert to agent listings within 30 days."

4. **"Your commission is too high"**
   - Rebuttal: "My commission covers [list services]. If you want to reduce it, let's discuss which services we'd adjust. Most sellers find full service yields higher net proceeds."

5. **"I need to think about it"**
   - Rebuttal: "Absolutely. What specific concerns can I address while you're thinking? I find most hesitation comes from [X, Y, Z] - any of those resonate?"

**Your Turn** - List YOUR top 10 objections and one-line rebuttals:
```
MY TOP 10 OBJECTIONS & REBUTTALS:

1. Objection:
   Rebuttal:

2. Objection:
   Rebuttal:

3. Objection:
   Rebuttal:

[Continue through 10...]

### Template Section 5: Micro-Geography Cheats (8 minutes)

**Your Task**: Capture hyper-local knowledge AI wouldn't know.

**Why This Matters**: This is your competitive advantage. AI doesn't know that "west of Mack Hatcher gets you Ravenwood HS" or that "Westhaven HOA has strictest rules."

**Categories to Document**:

**School Zones** (boundaries AI gets wrong):
- "Homes east of [street] go to [school]"
- "[Elementary] feeds into [middle] feeds into [high school]"
- "District lines shift at [landmark]"

**Commute Patterns**:
- "Downtown Nashville = 35-45 min in rush hour from [neighborhood]"
- "[Neighborhood] has easy I-65 access for Cool Springs commuters"

**HOA Nuances**:
- "[Neighborhood] HOA allows fences, but max 4ft height"
- "[Subdivision] has voluntary HOA ($200/yr, covers entrance only)"

**Neighborhood Insider Knowledge**:
- "[Neighborhood] mostly built 2005-2010, so HVAC systems are aging"
- "[Street] is a cut-through, more traffic noise"
- "[Park] is hidden gem, less crowded than [big park]"

**Your Turn** - Document your micro-geography knowledge:
```
MICRO-GEOGRAPHY CHEATS:

School Zones:
-
-

Commute:
-
-

HOA Notes:
-
-

Insider Knowledge:
-
-
```

### Template Section 6: Formatting Preferences (3 minutes)

**Your Task**: Tell AI how you want content structured.

**Why This Matters**: Consistent formatting = professional brand.

**Examples**:
- "Listing descriptions: 120-150 words, 2 short paragraphs + one line about CTA"
- "Emails: Greeting, 2-3 short paragraphs (max 4 sentences each), CTA, sign-off"
- "Social posts: Engaging first sentence, 3-4 bullets for key info, hashtags at end"
- "Never use all caps for emphasis"
- "Use em dashes for emphasis — like this"

**Your Turn** - Write your formatting rules:
```
FORMATTING PREFERENCES:
-
-
-
```

---

### Template Section 7: Compliance Notes (4 minutes)

**Your Task**: Document your non-negotiable compliance rules.

**Why This Matters**: AI doesn't know Fair Housing law, MLS rules, or your broker's policies.

**Standard Real Estate Compliance** (always include):
- "NEVER use demographic descriptors (families, young professionals, retirees, etc.)"
- "NEVER use subjective safety claims (safe, secure, crime-free)"
- "NEVER make unverifiable claims (best, perfect, guaranteed)"
- "Always include MLS disclaimer if using MLS data: [your MLS text]"
- "Follow Fair Housing guidelines - no steering language"

**Your Broker/MLS Rules** (add yours):
- "All listing photos must note if virtually staged"
- "Cannot advertise coming soon listings on social media per MLS rules"
- "[Other broker-specific policies]"

**Your Turn** - List your compliance guardrails:
```
COMPLIANCE NOTES:
-
-
-
-
```

## Facilitation Notes

### Setup (Before Exercise)
- Have template available in 3 formats: Google Doc (editable), PDF (fillable), Word Doc
- Pre-fill ONE complete example to show finished product
- Write section timing on board: "Voice (5) | Taboo (3) | CTA (5) | Objections (12) | Local (8) | Format (3) | Compliance (4)"
- Have objection examples ready to prompt idea generation

### While Facilitating

**0-5 min: Voice Pillars**
- Announce: "Section 1 - Voice Pillars. How do you sound? Start writing."
- At 2 min: "If you're stuck, think about client feedback. What do they say about working with you?"
- At 5 min: "Move to Section 2 - Taboo Phrases"

**5-8 min: Taboo Phrases**
- Announce: "Section 2 - What do you NEVER want to say? Fair Housing risks? Overused clichés?"
- At 7 min: "You should have 5+ phrases by now"
- At 8 min: "Move to Section 3 - CTAs"

**8-13 min: CTA Hierarchy**
- Announce: "Section 3 - How do you prefer to close your communications? Write your go-to CTAs."
- At 10 min: "Think about listings vs follow-up vs objections - different CTAs for each"
- At 13 min: "Move to Section 4 - Objections. This is the longest section, take your time."

**13-25 min: Objections + Rebuttals**
- Announce: "Section 4 - Top 10 objections. Write the exact objection you hear, then your proven rebuttal."
- At 16 min: "If you're stuck, think about your last 5 listing presentations. What questions came up?"
- At 20 min: "Halfway point - you should have 5 objections done"
- At 24 min: "Finish your 10th objection, or move on with what you have"
- At 25 min: "Move to Section 5 - Local knowledge"

**25-33 min: Micro-Geography**
- Announce: "Section 5 - This is your secret weapon. What do you know about your market that Zillow doesn't?"
- At 28 min: "Think school zones, HOA quirks, commute patterns, hidden gems"
- At 32 min: "Wrap up local knowledge"
- At 33 min: "Sections 6 and 7 - quick formatting and compliance notes"

**33-40 min: Formatting + Compliance**
- Announce: "Final two sections - quick hits. How do you format? What are your compliance rules?"
- At 36 min: "You should be on compliance now"
- At 40 min: "Pencils down. You have a first draft. This is a living document - you'll refine it over time."

### Debrief Questions (During share-backs, Module 7)
- "Who wants to share one objection rebuttal they're proud of?"
- "What local knowledge did you document that AI would never know?"
- "How will you use this context card in your prompts?"

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "I don't know my voice - I just sound like me"
**Solution**: "Ask yourself: formal or casual? Funny or serious? Educational or sales-y? Pick 3 words max."

**Issue**: "I can't think of 10 objections"
**Solution**: "Start with 5. Quality over quantity. You can add more later."

**Issue**: "My local knowledge is too basic"
**Solution**: "Basic to you = gold to AI. Even obvious facts help. 'School boundaries shift at Main St' is useful."

**Issue**: "This feels like busywork"
**Solution**: "I get it. But when you paste this into a prompt, AI matches your voice instantly. It's a multiplier."

**Issue**: "I finished way early"
**Solution**: "Great - now add edge cases. What objections do you hear from investors vs. first-time buyers? Different rebuttals?"

## Success Criteria

**Individual Success**:
- Completed at least 6 of 7 template sections (all but one)
- Voice pillars are specific (not generic like "professional, friendly")
- Objections are real scenarios they've encountered
- Local knowledge includes at least 3-4 specific details
- Compliance section includes Fair Housing basics
- Participant can explain how to USE the context card in a prompt

**Group Success**:
- 90%+ of participants have a usable draft by end of exercise
- Multiple volunteers share sections during share-backs
- Room discussions surface valuable local knowledge (cross-learning)
- Participants are excited about using this vs. seeing it as homework

**Quality Indicators**:
- Objection rebuttals are specific, not generic ("Let me address that" is too vague)
- Local knowledge is hyperlocal ("west of Highway 96" not "good area")
- Voice pillars differentiate them from competitors

---

## Variations

### For Advanced Participants
- Challenge: Create separate context cards for different buyer personas (first-time vs investor vs luxury)
- Challenge: Add a "competitor positioning" section (how you differ from discount brokers, iBuyers, etc.)
- Challenge: Include sample before/after prompts showing impact of context card

### For Beginners
- Simplification: Provide pre-filled examples for each section, they customize
- Simplification: Reduce objections from 10 to 5 must-haves
- Simplification: Skip micro-geography if they're new to market (can add later)

### Time Adjustments
**If running 10 minutes behind**:
- Reduce objections from 10 to 5
- Make micro-geography optional (bonus section)
- Combine formatting + compliance into one 5-min section

**If running 5 minutes ahead**:
- Add bonus section: "Sample Prompts Using This Context"
- Extended share-backs: 5 volunteers instead of 3

## Follow-Up

### Connection to Handouts
- **Context Card Template**: This IS the handout - participants keep their filled version
- **Prompting Checklist**: Context card works WITH prompts from Drill 1

### Connection to Next Activities
- **Module 7 (Job Scan)**: "Now that you have a context card, you'll identify which jobs to apply it to."
- **Capstone Sprint**: "Your context card is component #2 of your capstone pack."

### Post-Workshop Actions
- Digitize your context card (Google Doc, Notion, Evernote)
- Test it: Paste it into 3 different prompts this week and note quality improvement
- Iterate: Add objections as you encounter new ones
- Share: Compare context cards with colleague - cross-learn
