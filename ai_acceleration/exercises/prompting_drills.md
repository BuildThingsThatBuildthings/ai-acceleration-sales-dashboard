## Instructions for Participants

### Drill 1: Clarity Pass (5 minutes)

**Your Challenge**: Turn this vague request into a complete, clear prompt.

**Vague Starting Point**: "Help me write a listing description for my new property."

**Your Task**: Rewrite this as a complete prompt that includes ALL five elements:
1. **Audience**: Who is this for?
2. **Channel**: Where will this be used? (MLS, social media, email, etc.)
3. **Facts**: What property details must be included?
4. **Style**: What tone and length?
5. **Exclusions**: What should AI NOT say?

**Example Structure** (don't copy this - create your own):
```
You are my real estate copywriting assistant. Write a [LENGTH] [TYPE] for [PROPERTY]
targeting [AUDIENCE]. Facts (non-negotiable): [KEY DETAILS].
Style: [TONE/LENGTH]. Exclude: [DO-NOT-SAY ITEMS].
End with: [CALL TO ACTION].
```

**Self-Check** (Score yourself 0-5 points):
- [ ] Has target audience specified (1 pt)
- [ ] Specifies channel/format (1 pt)
- [ ] Includes key property facts (1 pt)
- [ ] Defines style/tone (1 pt)
- [ ] Lists exclusions/"do not say" items (1 pt)

**Success**: 4-5 points means you have a complete prompt ready to test.

### Drill 2: Constraint Layering (5 minutes)

**Your Challenge**: Take your prompt from Drill 1 and add precision through constraints.

**Add These 5 Constraints**:
1. **Length limit**: Specify exact word count (e.g., "120-150 words")
2. **Tone constraint**: Be specific (e.g., "conversational but professional, avoid real estate clichés")
3. **Local detail requirement**: Force AI to include neighborhood context (e.g., "must mention school proximity and downtown Franklin access")
4. **Do-not-say item 1**: Fair Housing protection (e.g., "do not use 'perfect for families' or any demographic descriptors")
5. **Do-not-say item 2**: Compliance protection (e.g., "no superlatives like 'best' or 'perfect' unless factually supported")

**Peer Review Option**: Trade prompts with person next to you. Check if all 5 constraints are present.

**Success**: Your enhanced prompt should force AI to produce a specific, compliant, usable output.

### Drill 3: Iteration Loop (5 minutes)

**Your Challenge**: Run your prompt from Drill 2, then improve the output through 2-3 iterations.

**Process**:
1. **Generate v1**: Run your complete prompt with constraints
2. **Evaluate v1**: What's good? What's missing or wrong?
3. **Iterate to v2**: Use ONE refinement command:
   - "Tighten this to exactly 130 words"
   - "Lead with the updated master suite feature"
   - "Make the tone warmer and less formal"
   - "Add a line about commute time to downtown"
   - "Remove the phrase [X] and replace with [Y]"
4. **Iterate to v3** (if needed): Apply one more refinement
5. **Final check**: Does this meet your quality bar? Would you publish this (after fact-checking)?

**Success Criteria**: v3 output is noticeably better than v1 in specificity, tone, or accuracy.

**Reality Check**: Always verify facts before publishing:
- [ ] Square footage matches MLS
- [ ] Bed/bath count is correct
- [ ] School names and ratings are accurate
- [ ] No Fair Housing violations present
- [ ] HOA details are factual

## Facilitation Notes

### Setup (Before Module Starts)
- Pre-load sample property details on screen
- Have Prompting Checklist handouts ready to distribute
- Test AI tool access (ensure Wi-Fi works)
- Write drill timing on whiteboard: "Drill 1: 5 min | Drill 2: 5 min | Drill 3: 5 min"
- Have timer ready (visible countdown helps pace)

### While Facilitating

**Drill 1 (0-5 min)**:
- Announce: "Start Drill 1 - you have 5 minutes"
- At 2 minutes: "Halfway point - make sure you have audience, channel, and facts"
- At 4 minutes: "One minute left - add your exclusions"
- At 5 minutes: "Pencils down. Self-score using the checklist. How many got 4-5 points? Raise hands."
- Quick share: "Anyone want to read their prompt aloud?" (Take 1-2 volunteers, give quick feedback)

**Drill 2 (5-10 min)**:
- Announce: "Drill 2 - layer in your 5 constraints. Same property, more precision."
- At 2.5 minutes: "Halfway - you should have length, tone, and local detail added"
- At 4 minutes: "Don't forget your two 'do not say' items for compliance"
- At 5 minutes: "Time. Peer review if you want - trade with your neighbor and check for all 5 constraints"
- Optional: Project one example prompt (anonymously) and point out strong constraint use

**Drill 3 (10-15 min)**:
- Announce: "Final drill - run your prompt and iterate. Generate v1, improve to v2, refine to v3."
- At 1 minute: "You should be running your prompt now"
- At 3 minutes: "Most of you should have v1. What needs improvement? Tell AI to fix it."
- At 4.5 minutes: "Wrap up your final iteration"
- At 5 minutes: "Time. Look at your v3 vs v1. Better? That's the process."
- Share out: "Who wants to show their before/after?" (Take 2 volunteers, celebrate improvement)

### Debrief Questions (2 minutes at end)
- "What was hardest about this exercise?"
- "What surprised you about AI's response?"
- "Which drill was most valuable - clarity, constraints, or iteration?"
- "Anyone have a prompt that totally flopped? That's normal - what did you learn?"

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "I don't have a laptop/internet"
**Solution**: Pair them with neighbor; they can observe and learn structure

**Issue**: "AI generated something completely wrong"
**Solution**: "Perfect - that's why we verify. What fact did AI hallucinate? How would you fix the prompt?"

**Issue**: "My prompt is too long/complicated"
**Solution**: "That's okay for now - better to over-specify than under-specify. You'll streamline with practice."

**Issue**: "I finished early, what now?"
**Solution**: "Try the prompt with a different property, or help your neighbor troubleshoot"

**Issue**: "AI won't follow my constraints"
**Solution**: "Make constraints more explicit. Instead of 'be brief,' say 'write exactly 120 words.'"

## Success Criteria

**Individual Success** (participant has achieved the objective):
- Created a complete prompt with all 5 elements (audience, channel, facts, style, exclusions)
- Applied at least 3 specific constraints to improve precision
- Successfully iterated to improve output quality
- Can identify which prompt elements led to better outputs
- Feels more confident about prompting process

**Group Success** (facilitation is working):
- 80%+ of participants complete at least 2 of 3 drills
- Multiple participants volunteer to share outputs
- Room energy is engaged (not confused or frustrated)
- Questions focus on refinement ("how do I make this better?") not basics ("what's a prompt?")

**Red Flags** (intervene immediately):
- More than 3 people look completely lost at 2-minute mark → Pause and walk through example together
- Nobody volunteers to share → Instructor shares own example to lower stakes
- Many people getting nonsensical AI outputs → Check if prompts have enough context

## Variations

### For Advanced Participants
- Challenge: Create a reusable prompt template with [PLACEHOLDERS] that works for any property
- Challenge: Add a verification checklist to your prompt (ask AI to list facts used in [FACT CHECK] section)
- Challenge: Create prompts for 3 different channels (MLS, Instagram caption, email to sphere) using same property

### For Beginners
- Simplification: Provide a prompt template with fill-in-the-blanks instead of starting from scratch
- Simplification: Skip Drill 2 (constraints), focus on Drill 1 (clarity) and Drill 3 (iteration)
- Support: Pair with more experienced participant for peer learning

### Time Adjustments
**If running 5 minutes behind**:
- Reduce Drill 2 to 3 minutes (fewer constraints)
- Cut share-outs between drills (save for debrief only)

**If running 5 minutes ahead**:
- Add bonus drill: "Create a social media post from your listing description"
- Extended share-out: 4-5 volunteers instead of 2-3

## Follow-Up

### Connection to Handouts
- **Prompting Checklist**: Participants should reference this during drills and keep for future use
- **Mental Models One-Pager**: Remind them of "Context Over Cleverness" and "OODA Loop" from Module 3

### Connection to Next Activities
- **Module 6 (Context Engineering)**: "You just practiced prompt structure. Next we'll create a reusable context card that makes EVERY prompt better."
- **Capstone Sprint (Module 12)**: "These drills teach the foundation. In the capstone, you'll build a complete prompt system for one of your pilot jobs."

### Homework (Optional)
- Try these 3 drills with a real property you're listing this week
- Create 3 prompt templates (listing, email, social post) and save them for reuse
- Share your best AI-generated listing in the group chat (celebrate wins)
