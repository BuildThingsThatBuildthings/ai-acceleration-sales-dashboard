## Exercise Design Principles

All exercises follow these principles:
- **Real estate specific**: Scenarios use actual RE workflows
- **Practical application**: No theory without practice
- **Clear success criteria**: Participants know when they've succeeded
- **Scalable**: Variations for beginners and advanced users
- **Measurable**: Time savings and quality improvements quantified
- **Safe experimentation**: Mistakes are learning opportunities

## File Structure

Each exercise file includes:
1. **Overview**: Purpose, module, time, format, materials
2. **Learning Objectives**: What participants will be able to do
3. **Instructions for Participants**: Step-by-step guidance
4. **Facilitation Notes**: Setup, timing, common issues, solutions
5. **Success Criteria**: Individual and group benchmarks
6. **Variations**: Advanced, beginner, and time-adjusted versions
7. **Follow-Up**: Connections to other activities and homework

## Integration with Workshop

These exercises support the overall workshop flow:
- **Morning (Modules 5-6)**: Prompting fundamentals and context engineering
- **Lunch Break**: Reinforcement and optional office hours
- **Afternoon (Modules 8-11)**: Job identification, safety, and application
- **Final Hour (Module 12)**: Capstone integration and commitment

## Time Budget

Total exercise time: **195 minutes** (3 hours 15 minutes)
- Prompting Drills: 15 min
- Context Cards: 40 min
- Job Scan: 35 min
- Fraud Demos: 30 min
- Desktop AI: 45 min
- Capstone Sprint: 30 min

Remaining workshop time (225 min) allocated to:
