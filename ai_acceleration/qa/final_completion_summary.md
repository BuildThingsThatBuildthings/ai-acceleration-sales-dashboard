## Final Recommendations

### Priority 1: Before Workshop
1. **Get client approval** on 12-module design (vs. 9 specified)
   - Frame as value-add: better framing, integration, action planning
   - Show that all 9 original modules are fully implemented
   - Highlight pedagogical benefits

2. **Attorney review** fraud handout liability language
   - Especially disclaimer on legal/liability implications
   - Ensure "verify via known channel" SOP is defensible

3. **Test format conversions** (MD → PDF, MD → Slides)
   - Verify fonts render correctly
   - Check QR code placeholders convert
   - Test print quality in B&W

### Priority 2: Workshop Delivery
1. **Timing management** - 12 modules in 7 hours is tight
   - Use instructor guide timing cues
   - Know what to cut if running long (marked in guide)
   - Build buffer into breaks

2. **Demo readiness** - Have backup plans for tech failures
   - Offline screenshots of AI outputs
   - Backup WiFi (mobile hotspot)
   - Pre-loaded examples in case AI tools are slow

3. **Participant engagement** - Workshop lives or dies on interaction
   - Use exercises as energy breaks
   - Call on different people (not just volunteers)
   - Validate all questions (no "dumb questions")

### Priority 3: Post-Workshop
1. **Resource hub hosting** - Get participant_resource_library.md online ASAP
   - Participants need access on Day 1 post-workshop
   - Test QR codes work from printed handouts
   - Consider short URL for easy sharing

2. **Alumni community** - Keep momentum going
   - Launch group within 48 hours of workshop
   - Seed with 3-5 discussion prompts
   - Assign moderators (instructor + 1-2 power users)

3. **Feedback collection** - Measure and improve
   - What worked? What didn't?
   - Which tools are participants actually using 30 days later?
   - Use data to refine for future workshops
