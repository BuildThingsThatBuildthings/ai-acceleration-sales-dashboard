# Assessment Strategy & Tools
**AI Acceleration Workshop for Real Estate Professionals**

**Course**: Williamson County Association of REALTORS (WCAR)
**Duration**: 9:00 AM - 4:00 PM
**Assessment Designer**: Requirements Analyst
**Date**: November 12, 2025

---

## Assessment Philosophy

**Guiding Principles**:
- **Application over memorization** - Measure ability to DO, not recite
- **Scenario-based authenticity** - Use real real estate situations, not abstract examples
- **Formative growth focus** - Assessments guide learning, not just measure it
- **Safe experimentation** - Mistakes during practice are learning opportunities
- **Transfer to workplace** - Success = using AI tools Monday morning, not scoring high on quiz

**Formative vs. Summative Balance**:
- **Formative (70%)**: Frequent low-stakes checks during practice; immediate feedback loops; self-assessment
- **Summative (30%)**: Capstone project demonstration; post-assessment comparison; transfer measurement

**Growth Mindset Integration**:
- Frame struggles as normal: "AI rarely gets it perfect on first try - iteration is the process"
- Celebrate progress: "Look how far you've come since 9 AM"
- Provide multiple attempts: Rapid iteration cycles build confidence
- Peer learning: Share successes and troubleshooting strategies

**Task**:
Use AI to draft an email that:
- Opens with empathy and acknowledgment of their situation

The email looks legitimate but something feels slightly off - there's unusual urgency and a request to "reply ASAP, don't call, I'm in meetings all day."

**Task**:
Use the AI fraud checklist to analyze this email:
1. Check sender domain
2. Check thread continuity
3. Check for urgency pressure
4. Identify wire instruction changes

**Task**:
Use AI to create:
- A 3-sentence response explaining CMA vs. Zestimate
- Supporting points about data sources and accuracy

**Task**:
Use AI to create a template prompt you can reuse for every transaction handoff:

**Requirements**:
Your capstone pack must include all 5 components:

### 1. Prompt File
A reusable prompt (or prompt sequence) that:
- Clearly defines the task
- Includes role/audience/constraints
- Incorporates context from your Voice & Tactics Card
- Can be used repeatedly (template with [PLACEHOLDERS])

**Example Structure**:
```
You are my real estate copywriting assistant.

TASK: Write a [TYPE] for [PROPERTY/CLIENT] targeting [AUDIENCE].

CONTEXT:
[Paste relevant section of Voice & Tactics Card]

FACTS (non-negotiable):
[Property specs / client details / data points]

STYLE: [Tone/length/format requirements]

EXCLUDE: [Do-not-say items, Fair Housing risks]

### 3. Two Sample Inputs
Real or realistic examples you'd paste into AI:
- Input A: Typical scenario
- Input B: More complex scenario

These demonstrate the range of situations your system handles.

### 4. Two Verified Outputs
AI-generated results from your sample inputs, reviewed and edited by you:
- Output A: Result from Input A (marked with edits/verification)
- Output B: Result from Input B (marked with edits/verification)

Include notes on what you verified, what you changed, what you approved as-is.

### 5. Measurement Plan
How you'll track success of this AI system:
- **Current state**: Minutes/hours spent on this task per week
- **Target state**: Minutes/hours after AI implementation
- **Time saved**: Quantified difference
- **Quality proxy**: How you'll ensure quality doesn't drop (checklist, peer review, client feedback)
- **Review schedule**: When you'll evaluate if system is working (weekly? monthly?)

**Time Allocation**: 30 minutes

**Support Materials Provided**:
- Capstone Pack Template folder (digital)
- Prompt structure examples
- Context Card from morning session
- Checklist for completeness

**Submission**:

- Post-assessment: Google Form (exported to spreadsheet)
- 30-day follow-up: Email survey (automated via Mailchimp/similar)

**Key Metrics to Track**:

**Workshop Effectiveness**:
- Confidence gain: Pre-Q2 vs Post-Q1 (target: 80%+ improve)
- Knowledge acquisition: Post-Q3-6 accuracy (target: 85%+ correct)
- Capstone quality: Average score (target: 7.5+ out of 10)
- NPS score: Post-Q10 (target: 8+ average)

**Skill Transfer**:

## Grading Guidelines

**Philosophy**: This is professional development, not academic coursework. "Grading" serves to:
- Provide feedback for improvement
- Recognize achievement
- Identify participants needing additional support
- Not to rank or penalize

**Formative Assessments**: Not graded; feedback only
- Purpose: Guide learning in the moment
- Format: Instructor comments, peer feedback, self-check
- No scores recorded

**Summative Assessments**: Graded with rubric; low-stakes
- Capstone project: 10-point rubric (detailed above)
- Knowledge checks: Pass/Fail (5/6 correct on fraud quiz)
- Purpose: Verify competency, not compete

**Certificate of Completion Requirements**:
- [ ] Attended full workshop (9 AM - 4 PM)
- [ ] Participated in hands-on exercises
- [ ] Submitted capstone project (scored 5+ out of 10 minimum)
- [ ] Completed post-assessment

**Recognition Levels**:
- **Certificate of Completion**: Met basic requirements above
- **Certificate of Excellence**: Capstone scored 9+ AND demonstrated leadership/peer support during workshop
- **AI-Accelerated Realtor Badge**: Completion + 30-day follow-up showing active implementation

**No Failing**:
- This is not a pass/fail course in traditional sense
- All participants receive completion certificate if they attend and participate
- Low capstone scores trigger support offers, not failure notices
- Growth mindset: "Not yet proficient" vs "failed"

## Accessibility Considerations

**Universal Design Principles**:
- Multiple means of representation (visual, auditory, hands-on)
- Multiple means of engagement (individual, pair, group work)
- Multiple means of expression (written, verbal, demonstration)

**Technology Access**:
- **Assumption**: Participants have laptops/tablets (workshop requirement)
- **Backup**: Borrow device from WCAR or pair with another participant
- **Internet**: WCAR provides reliable Wi-Fi; test capacity pre-workshop
- **Accounts**: Free ChatGPT accounts only (no paid subscriptions required)

**Learning Differences**:
- **Visual learners**: Slides, diagrams, job aids, live demonstrations
- **Auditory learners**: Instructor narration, discussion, Q&A
- **Kinesthetic learners**: Hands-on practice (70% of workshop time)
- **Reading/writing**: Printed materials, written exercises, templates

**Language & Literacy**:
- **Plain language**: Avoid jargon; define technical terms
- **Examples**: Use real estate context, not abstract concepts
- **Reading level**: Materials written at 8th-grade level or below
- **Bilingual support**: If needed, provide Spanish translations (Williamson County demographics)

**Pace & Processing Time**:
- **Frequent breaks**: Every 60-90 minutes
- **Think time**: Pause 5-10 seconds after questions before calling for answers
- **Extended time**: Participants can work at own pace during practice sessions
- **Recordings**: Optional - record demos for later review (if permitted)

**Physical Accommodations**:
- **Seating**: Tables with space for laptops; ability to stand/stretch
- **Movement**: Encourage standing exercises; pair rotations
- **Breaks**: Sufficient time for restroom, refreshments, movement

**Neurodiverse Learners**:
- **Structure**: Clear agenda; module transitions announced
- **Predictability**: Scaffolded progression; no surprise activities
- **Stimulation**: Manage noise levels; allow headphones during individual work if helpful
- **Flexibility**: Choice in exercise scenarios; self-paced practice

**Experience Levels**:
- **Novice-friendly**: No prior AI experience required; start at ground zero
- **Advanced options**: Bonus challenges for faster learners during practice time
- **Peer support**: Pair less confident with more experienced participants
- **Multiple entry points**: Can jump in at any skill level

**Asking for Help**:
- **Normalized**: "Raise hand anytime you're stuck - that's what I'm here for"
- **Multiple channels**: Hand raise, Slack message, grab instructor during break
- **Peer helpers**: Encourage participants to help each other
- **No stupid questions**: Explicitly stated and reinforced

**Assessment Accommodations**:
- **Extended time**: Available for capstone project (can finish at home)
- **Alternate formats**: Verbal presentation vs. written submission if needed
- **Assistive technology**: Screen readers, speech-to-text, magnification supported
- **Simplified language**: Assessment questions written clearly; no trick questions

**Post-Workshop Support**:
- **Ongoing access**: Materials remain available digitally
- **Office hours**: Virtual Q&A for those who need extra help
- **Email support**: Questions welcomed after workshop
- **Peer community**: Slack/WhatsApp group for ongoing support
