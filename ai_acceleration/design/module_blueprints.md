### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (2 min)
**Purpose**: Set tone, create energy, establish credibility
**Method**: Personal story + provocative statement
**Content**:
- Instructor introduction: "I'm Ryan, I've spent [X] years helping professionals use AI without the hype"
- Opening statement: "Here's what won't happen today: death by PowerPoint, jargon overload, or tools you'll never use. Here's what will happen: you'll create real AI outputs for your business in the first hour, and leave with systems you'll use Monday morning"
- Show of hands: "Who's tried ChatGPT? Who uses it weekly? Who's skeptical this will work?" (calibrate room)

#### 2. Core Teaching (5 min)
**Concept 1: Outcomes Over Hype**
- Method: Direct instruction with slide
- Key points:
  - "We're not here to talk about AI, we're here to use it"
  - "Everything we do today has one question: does this save you time or make you money?"
  - "If it doesn't pass that test, we skip it"
- Visual aid: Slide showing workshop outcomes in plain language

- "Ready to dive in?"

**Transition to next module**:
- "Let's start by hearing from you - what do you need AI to solve? That's Module 2"

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 3 slides (Welcome, Agenda, House Rules)
- **Handouts**: None for this module (main handouts distributed at break)
- **Templates**: None
- **Technology**: Projector/screen

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't spend too much time on instructor bio (they care about outcomes, not credentials)
- Don't oversell - let results speak through the day
- Watch for anxiety in faces when you mention "hands-on" - reassure immediately

**Likely questions**:
- "Do I need to install anything?" → No, web-based tools only
- "What if I've never used AI?" → Perfect, we start from zero
- "Will this be recorded?" → Address based on your policy

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress to 8 minutes if running behind
- Can extend to 12 minutes if lots of questions
- Priority is psychological safety + clarity, not rigid timing

---

## Module 2: Opening Q&A Pulse

**Time Allocation**: 9:10-9:30 (20 minutes)
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Surface top priority use cases for the room
- Create shared understanding of pain points
- Identify 5-7 "jobs to be done" that AI can address
- Build peer learning foundation (realize others share challenges)

**Prerequisites**: Module 1 complete (framing established)

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (2 min)
**Purpose**: Shift from instructor-led to participant-led, create ownership
**Method**: Direct question + whiteboard prep
**Content**:
- "You know your business better than I do. So before I show you what AI can do, tell me: what takes too much time in your day?"
- Set up whiteboard (or digital equivalent) with three columns:
  - **Job/Task** | **Time Spent** | **Pain Level (1-5)**
- Rules: "Call it out, I'll write it fast, no wrong answers"

#### 2. Core Teaching (0 min)
**N/A** - This module is pure data collection and synthesis, minimal teaching

#### 3. Demonstration (0 min)
**N/A** - No demo, this is interactive discussion

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (14 min)
**Exercise**: Priority Stack Creation
**Format**: Whole-group facilitated discussion
**Materials needed**: Whiteboard/flip chart, markers
**Success criteria**: 15-20 jobs identified, top 5-7 voted/prioritized

**Process**:
1. **Rapid-fire job identification (7 min)**
   - Instructor calls on participants or takes volunteers
   - Each person names 1-2 tasks that consume too much time
   - Instructor writes quickly on whiteboard (exact wording doesn't matter)
   - No discussion yet, just capture
   - Examples to prompt if room is quiet:
     - "Writing listing descriptions"
     - "Responding to the same client questions over and over"
     - "Creating social media posts"
     - "Summarizing market reports for clients"
     - "Email follow-up sequences"
     - "Researching comps for CMAs"

2. **Clustering similar jobs (3 min)**
   - Instructor groups related tasks together
   - Example clusters:
     - Content creation (listings, social, emails)
     - Client communication (follow-up, Q&A, updates)
     - Market research/analysis (comps, trends, reports)
     - Transaction coordination (paperwork, scheduling)
   - Ask room: "Did I miss any? Should any of these be combined?"

3. **Dot voting for priorities (4 min)**
   - Each participant gets 3 votes (real or virtual dots)
   - Vote for tasks they most want to solve with AI
   - Instructor tallies and circles top 5-7 jobs
   - These become the "Target Jobs" for the day

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (4 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "Look at that - [X] different tasks, but they cluster into [3-4] categories"
- "Good news: AI is great at most of these. We'll tackle the top ones today"
- Call out specific patterns: "Almost everyone said content creation - we start there after break"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "Surprised by what others said?"
- "Anyone have a job that didn't make the list but you're curious about?"

**Transition to next module**:
- "Before we jump into tools and tactics, we need mental models - how to think about AI so you use it right and avoid mistakes. That's Module 3"

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 1 slide ("What Takes Too Much Time?")
- **Handouts**: None
- **Templates**: None
- **Technology**: Whiteboard or digital whiteboard (Miro, Mural, etc.)

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't let one person dominate - spread participation
- Don't debate feasibility yet ("can AI do that?") - just capture
- Don't let this run long - 20 min max, move on even if not exhaustive

**Likely questions**:
- "Can AI really do [complex strategic task]?" → "Let's find out today"
- "What if my biggest problem isn't on the list?" → "We'll cover it in Q&A or office hours"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress to 15 minutes if list emerges quickly
- CANNOT extend beyond 25 minutes or rest of schedule suffers
- Priority is capturing 5-7 clear jobs, not 30 mediocre ones

**Energy management**:
- This is high-energy - call and response, movement to board
- Use humor when jobs are relatable ("raise your hand if you've spent 2 hours on an email")

---

## Module 3: Mental Models for AI

**Time Allocation**: 9:30-9:55 (25 minutes)
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Understand 5 core mental models for thinking about AI
- Calibrate expectations (what AI is/isn't, trust-but-verify mindset)
- Grasp "context over cleverness" principle
- Adopt OODA-style iteration loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act)
- Frame AI as "scaling your best people" not "replacing humans"

**Prerequisites**: Module 2 complete (pain points identified, ready for conceptual framework)

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (3 min)
**Purpose**: Create curiosity, show value of mental models
**Method**: Story + visual analogy
**Content**:
- Story: "Two agents both try AI for listing descriptions. One gives up in 10 minutes saying 'it doesn't work.' The other generates 5 great listings in 20 minutes. Same tool. What's the difference? Mental models."
- Analogy: "Mental models are like cheat codes for your brain. They help you see patterns fast"
- Promise: "These 5 models will save you hours of frustration and bad AI outputs"

#### 2. Core Teaching (15 min)
**Teaching method**: Mini-lecture with visual slides, real-world examples after each model

**Mental Model 1: AI as "Smart Intern" (3 min)**
- Definition: AI has read everything but needs clear instructions and supervision
- Key insight: You wouldn't send an intern to a client meeting alone - don't publish AI content without review
- Real estate example: "AI can draft your listing description fast, but you verify accuracy (sqft, beds/baths, school zones)"
- Visual aid: Diagram showing AI → Draft → Human Review → Publish
- **Catch phrase**: "AI does the first draft, you do the final cut"

**Mental Model 2: Trust But Verify (3 min)**
- Definition: AI will confidently state things that are wrong (hallucinations)
- Key insight: Verify every fact, especially numbers, addresses, claims
- Real estate example: "AI might say 'close to top-rated schools' when there are no schools nearby - always fact-check"
- Visual aid: Side-by-side comparison of AI output with [FACT CHECK] blocks highlighted
- **Catch phrase**: "If AI says it, verify it"

**Mental Model 3: Context Over Cleverness (3 min)**
- Definition: AI quality depends on context you provide, not prompt cleverness
- Key insight: More specifics = better output. Generic prompts = generic results
- Real estate example: Compare two prompts:
  - Bad: "Write a listing description"
  - Good: "Write a 150-word listing for 123 Main St, 3bd/2ba ranch, updated kitchen, cul-de-sac lot, Williamson schools, target first-time buyers, friendly but professional tone"
- Visual aid: Side-by-side outputs showing generic vs. specific results
- **Catch phrase**: "Feed it details, get back quality"

**Mental Model 4: OODA Loop (Small Iterations) (3 min)**
- Definition: Observe output → Orient (is this right?) → Decide what to change → Act (iterate)
- Key insight: AI rarely nails it on first try. Iteration is the process, not failure
- Real estate example: "Generate listing → Too formal → Ask AI to make it friendlier → Add local detail → Perfect"
- Visual aid: Circular diagram showing OODA loop
- **Catch phrase**: "Ship small, iterate fast"

**Mental Model 5: Scaling Your Best People (3 min)**
- Definition: AI captures and scales what your top performers do
- Key insight: Not about replacing humans, about multiplying best practices
- Real estate example: "Your best agent's listing voice can be taught to AI, then used by newer agents"
- Visual aid: Before/After productivity chart (one person's output → team's output)
- **Catch phrase**: "Amplify excellence, don't replace humans"

#### 3. Demonstration (2 min)
**What to demo**: OODA loop in action with live listing description
**Setup needed**: ChatGPT open, sample property details ready
**Demo script**:
1. Show generic prompt: "Write a listing for a 3-bedroom house"
2. Show generic output (boring, cookie-cutter)
3. Iterate: "Make it more specific to Williamson County, add mention of schools"
4. Show improved output
5. Iterate: "Tighten to 120 words, use friendlier tone"
6. Show final output (much better)
7. Point out: "Three iterations, 2 minutes total. That's the process"

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (3 min)
**Exercise**: Mental Model Application
**Format**: Think-pair-share
**Materials needed**: None (mental exercise)
**Success criteria**: Participants can name which mental model applies to a scenario

**Process**:
1. Instructor poses 3 scenarios:
   - Scenario A: "AI wrote a listing that says the house has 4 bedrooms, but it actually has 3" → Which model? (Trust But Verify)
   - Scenario B: "Your AI listing is boring and generic" → Which model? (Context Over Cleverness)
   - Scenario C: "First AI output wasn't great, so you tried again and it got better" → Which model? (OODA Loop)

2. Participants discuss with person next to them (30 sec each scenario)

3. Instructor calls on volunteers for answers, confirms correct model

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (2 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "These 5 models are your foundation - we'll use them all day"
- "When AI doesn't work, ask: did I give enough context? Did I verify? Did I iterate?"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "Which model resonates most?"
- "Which will be hardest to remember?"

**Transition to next module**:
- "Now that you know how to think about AI, let's define what it actually is and where it fits in real estate work. Module 4"

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 6 slides (1 intro, 5 mental models, 1 summary)
- **Handouts**: Mental Models one-pager (distributed at first break)
- **Templates**: None
- **Technology**: ChatGPT for live demo

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't get too academic on mental models - keep it practical and story-driven
- Don't skip the real estate examples - they make it concrete
- Don't rush the OODA demo - it's critical for later modules

**Likely questions**:
- "How do I know when to stop iterating?" → "When output meets your quality bar, usually 2-3 rounds"
- "Can I use AI for [complex strategic task]?" → "Depends on the task, we'll cover fit in next module"
- "What if I forget these models?" → "You have a handout, and we'll reinforce all day"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress teaching to 12 min if needed (2 min per model, lighter examples)
- CANNOT skip demo - it's the bridge to hands-on work
- If running behind, cut the practice exercise to 2 min

**Energy management**:
- This is still conceptual but more engaging than pure theory
- Use humor in examples ("we've all gotten weird AI outputs")
- Keep pace brisk - 25 min is max attention span for concepts

---

## Module 4: What AI Is / Isn't

**Time Allocation**: 9:55-10:25 (30 minutes, then 10-min break)
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Define AI in plain language (word engine, not truth engine)
- Identify strong fit use cases for real estate (drafts, rewrites, summaries, variations)
- Identify weak fit use cases (needs facts not provided, judgment calls)
- Understand limitations (hallucinations, recency, no access to your data)
- Feel confident about when to use AI vs. when to rely on human expertise

**Prerequisites**: Module 3 complete (mental models established)

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (3 min)
**Purpose**: Create accurate mental model of what AI actually is
**Method**: Provocative definition + visual metaphor
**Content**:
- Statement: "AI is not magic, it's not intelligent, and it's not trying to take your job. So what is it?"
- Definition: "AI is a word engine. It predicts what words/ideas should come next based on patterns it learned"
- Analogy: "It's like advanced autocomplete on your phone - but for entire paragraphs"
- Show visual: Phone autocomplete screenshot → expand to show AI doing same thing at paragraph scale

#### 2. Core Teaching (15 min)
**Teaching method**: Direct instruction with strong visual aids and frequent real estate examples

**Concept 1: Word Engine, Not Truth Engine (5 min)**
- What it means:
  - AI generates text that sounds plausible, not necessarily accurate
  - It has no fact-checking mechanism
  - It doesn't "know" anything - it pattern-matches
- Real estate implication:
  - AI can write a beautiful listing description for an address that doesn't exist
  - AI will confidently state wrong square footage if you don't provide it
  - ALWAYS verify facts, dates, numbers, claims
- Visual aid: Side-by-side showing "AI Output" → "Human Verification" → "Published Version"
- **Catch phrase**: "Sounds true ≠ is true"

**Concept 2: Strong Fit Use Cases (5 min)**
- Where AI excels in real estate:
  1. **Drafts**: First version of listing descriptions, emails, social posts
  2. **Rewrites**: "Make this friendlier/shorter/more professional"
  3. **Summaries**: Condense long market reports, email threads, PDFs
  4. **Variations**: "Give me 5 versions of this headline"
  5. **Formatting**: Turn bullet points into prose, prose into bullets
- Key insight: AI shines when you have the facts and need the words
- Real estate examples (rapid-fire):
  - Listing description draft from MLS data
  - Email response to common buyer question
  - Social media post about new listing
  - Open house invitation wording
  - Market update summary for sphere of influence
- Visual aid: Grid showing "AI Task" → "Input You Provide" → "Output You Get" → "Time Saved"

**Concept 3: Weak Fit Use Cases (5 min)**
- Where AI struggles or fails:
  1. **Facts it doesn't have**: Local market trends, specific property details, your client's preferences
  2. **Judgment calls**: Should this buyer see this house? Is this offer fair? What's my negotiation strategy?
  3. **Relationships**: Building trust, reading emotional cues, personal connection
  4. **Compliance/Legal**: Fair housing interpretation, contract terms, legal advice
  5. **Creativity requiring lived experience**: Unique positioning, hyperlocal storytelling, crisis management
- Key insight: AI can assist with research or drafts, but human expertise drives the decision
- Real estate examples (rapid-fire):
  - AI can summarize comparable sales → Human decides pricing strategy
  - AI can draft objection responses → Human adapts to specific client's concerns
  - AI can generate email copy → Human maintains authentic relationship
  - AI can list Fair Housing rules → Human applies judgment to gray areas
- Visual aid: Decision tree: "Does AI have the facts?" → Yes: Strong fit / No: Weak fit
- **Catch phrase**: "AI for the busywork, humans for the judgment"

#### 3. Demonstration (7 min)
**What to demo**: Strong fit vs. weak fit in action
**Setup needed**: ChatGPT open, sample property details ready
**Demo script**:

**Demo A: Strong Fit - Listing Description (3 min)**
1. Show prompt with full context:
   "Write a 140-word listing description for 456 Oak Street, Williamson County. 3 bed, 2 bath, 1,850 sqft ranch. Updated kitchen (2022), hardwood floors, fenced backyard, cul-de-sac lot. Nearby: Walnut Grove Elementary (8/10 rating), 10 min to downtown Franklin. Target audience: first-time homebuyers. Tone: friendly but professional. Avoid superlatives. Include school and commute details."
2. Generate output live
3. Point out: "That's usable in 30 seconds because I gave it all the facts"
4. Show one iteration: "Tighten to 120 words, lead with the updated kitchen"
5. Show improved output

**Demo B: Weak Fit - Pricing Strategy (2 min)**
1. Show prompt without context:
   "What should I price this house at?"
2. Generate output (will be generic advice)
3. Point out: "This is useless because AI doesn't know the market, the condition, or comps"
4. Explain: "AI can help with comp summaries, but YOU make the pricing call"

**Demo C: Medium Fit - Email Response with Facts (2 min)**
1. Show prompt with context:
   "Draft a response to a buyer asking about schools near 456 Oak. Facts: Walnut Grove Elementary is 0.5 miles away, rated 8/10 on GreatSchools. Williamson County schools are highly regarded. Keep it under 100 words, professional but warm."
2. Generate output live
3. Point out: "Good start because I provided the facts. I'd personalize the opening and closing"

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (2 min)
**Exercise**: Fit Assessment
**Format**: Individual quick-think, then group share
**Materials needed**: None
**Success criteria**: Participants can correctly identify strong vs. weak fit for 3 scenarios

**Process**:
1. Instructor shows 3 scenarios on screen, participants think silently:
   - Scenario A: "Rewrite my email to be more concise" → Strong or weak fit?
   - Scenario B: "Tell me if I should accept this offer" → Strong or weak fit?
   - Scenario C: "Create 5 subject line options for my newsletter" → Strong or weak fit?
2. Participants call out answers (or use poll if virtual)
3. Instructor confirms:
   - A: Strong (clear task, you have the content)
   - B: Weak (requires judgment AI doesn't have)
   - C: Strong (creative variations, clear input)

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (3 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "AI is great at words, terrible at truth. Feed it facts, verify outputs"
- "Use AI for drafts/rewrites/summaries. Keep humans in the loop for judgment"
- "When in doubt: Can AI access the facts? If no, it's a weak fit"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "What's a task you do that sounds like a strong fit?"
- "What's something you'd never trust to AI?"

**Transition to next module**:
- "You know what AI is and where it fits. Now let's learn how to actually use it - prompting fundamentals. That's after break. See you in 10 minutes"

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 8 slides total
  - Intro: "What is AI?"
  - Word engine definition
  - Strong fit use cases (with examples grid)
  - Weak fit use cases (with decision tree)
  - Demo setup slide
  - Fit assessment scenarios
  - Key takeaways
  - Break slide
- **Handouts**: None yet (distributed after break)
- **Templates**: None
- **Technology**: ChatGPT for live demos

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't get technical about how AI works (neural networks, transformers, etc.) - keep it simple
- Don't oversell AI's capabilities - honesty builds trust
- Don't undersell either - show genuine time savings

**Likely questions**:
- "Can AI access MLS data?" → "Not unless you copy/paste it in. AI doesn't have direct access to your systems"
- "Is AI always wrong?" → "No, it's often right, but you must verify. It has no mechanism to distinguish true from false"
- "Should I disclose I used AI?" → "For content: usually no, as long as you verified it. For advice/decisions: AI shouldn't be making those anyway"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress teaching to 12 min (3 min per concept, lighter examples)
- CANNOT skip demos - they're proof of concepts
- Can skip practice exercise if running behind (move to Module 5)
- Must end by 10:25 for break

**Energy management**:
- This is final push before break - keep energy high
- Use humor in weak fit examples ("AI can't tell you if that buyer is serious")
- End on encouraging note: "Let's take 10 and come back ready to build your first real outputs"

---

## Module 5: Prompting Fundamentals

**Time Allocation**: 10:35-11:10 (35 minutes, post-break)
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Write effective prompts using 5-element framework (5-element framework)
- Iterate on prompts to improve outputs
- Use constraints effectively (length, tone, exclusions)
- Apply prompting skills to real estate use cases
- Leave with 3 usable prompts for own business

**Prerequisites**: Module 4 complete (understand AI capabilities/limitations), 10-min break complete (fresh energy)

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (3 min)
**Purpose**: Create excitement for hands-on work, show value of structured prompting
**Method**: Before/after comparison
**Content**:
- Show two prompts side-by-side:
  - **Bad**: "Write a listing description"
  - **Good**: "Write a 150-word listing description for 789 Maple Ave, 4bd/3ba two-story, targeting move-up buyers, professional tone, lead with the gourmet kitchen and main-floor master, mention Williamson schools, avoid any Fair Housing issues"
- Show outputs (generic vs. specific)
- Statement: "The difference between 'AI doesn't work' and 'AI saves me hours' is your prompt. Let's learn the formula"

#### 2. Core Teaching (12 min)
**Teaching method**: Framework-based instruction with real estate examples for each element

**The Structured Prompting** (12 min total)

**C - Context (2 min)**
- What it is: Role, audience, channel, purpose
- Why it matters: AI adapts style based on context
- Real estate example:
  - "You are my real estate copywriter. Write for first-time homebuyers who will see this on Zillow"
- Template: "You are [role]. Write for [audience] who will see this on [channel]"

**L - Length & Format (2 min)**
- What it is: Word count, structure, formatting preferences
- Why it matters: Prevents rambling or too-short outputs
- Real estate example:
  - "120-150 words, 2 short paragraphs, end with one-line call to action"
- Template: "[X] words, [structure], [any formatting notes]"

**E - Essential Facts (3 min)**
- What it is: Non-negotiable details AI must include
- Why it matters: Accuracy and relevance depend on this
- Real estate example:
  - "Facts: 3bd/2ba, 1,400 sqft, updated kitchen (2023), fenced yard, Walnut Grove Elementary zone, cul-de-sac, $389K"
- Template: "Facts: [list all specific details]"
- **Critical note**: "This is where you prevent hallucinations - give AI the facts"

**A - Approach/Tone (2 min)**
- What it is: Voice, style, emotional register
- Why it matters: Determines how relatable and on-brand the output is
- Real estate example:
  - "Tone: friendly but professional, approachable not salesy, emphasize family-friendly features"
- Template: "Tone: [adjectives], [what to emphasize]"

**R - Restrictions & Exclusions (3 min)**
- What it is: What NOT to say or do
- Why it matters: Compliance, brand protection, avoiding clichés
- Real estate examples:
  - "Do not use superlatives like 'stunning' or 'gorgeous'"
  - "Avoid any language that could violate Fair Housing (no 'perfect for families,' 'great church nearby,' etc.)"
  - "Do not mention price - that's in the MLS field"
- Template: "Do not: [list prohibitions]"

**Putting it together: Full structured prompt example (shown on slide)**
```
You are my real estate copywriter. Write a listing description for first-time homebuyers who will read this on Zillow.

Length: 140-160 words, 2 paragraphs, friendly but professional tone.

Facts: 567 Pine Street, Williamson County. 3 bed, 2 bath, 1,650 sqft ranch. Renovated kitchen (quartz counters, stainless appliances) in 2022. Hardwood floors in living areas. Fenced backyard, two-car garage. Walnut Grove Elementary school zone. Cul-de-sac location. Close to parks and downtown Franklin (10 min drive).

Approach: Emphasize the updated kitchen and family-friendly features (yard, schools). Make it warm and inviting, not salesy.

Restrictions: No superlatives. No Fair Housing violations (don't say 'perfect for families'). Don't mention price. Lead with the kitchen.
```

#### 3. Demonstration (10 min)
**What to demo**: Full prompting workflow - initial prompt, evaluate, iterate twice
**Setup needed**: ChatGPT open, sample property details ready
**Demo script**:

**Round 1: Initial Prompt (3 min)**
1. Type structured prompt live (or use pre-written for speed)
2. Generate output
3. Read aloud, point out what works:
   - "Good: It led with kitchen as requested"
   - "Good: Tone is friendly"
   - "Good: No Fair Housing issues"
4. Point out what needs improvement:
   - "Hmm: It's 170 words, over the limit"
   - "Hmm: Didn't mention the cul-de-sac location"

**Round 2: Iteration (3 min)**
1. Type follow-up prompt:
   "Tighten to 150 words max. Add a mention of the quiet cul-de-sac location in the first paragraph"
2. Generate revised output
3. Read aloud, evaluate:
   - "Better: Now 148 words"
   - "Better: Cul-de-sac is in there"
   - "Issue: The closing line is weak"

**Round 3: Final Polish (3 min)**
1. Type follow-up prompt:
   "Rewrite the last sentence as a stronger call to action - invite them to schedule a showing"
2. Generate final output
3. Read aloud: "That's it - ready to publish"
4. Meta-commentary: "Three rounds, 5 minutes total. That's the process"

**Key teaching moment after demo:**
- "Did AI nail it on the first try? No. Does it need to? No. Iteration is normal and fast"

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (8 min)
**Exercise**: Write Your First Structured Prompt
**Format**: Individual work with instructor support
**Materials needed**: Prompt template handout (or on screen), own property/business details
**Success criteria**: Generate one usable output for real business need

**Process**:
1. **Setup (1 min)**: Instructor instructs participants to choose one task:
   - Option A: Listing description for property you're working on
   - Option B: Email response to common buyer/seller question
   - Option C: Social media post about your business or listing

2. **Draft prompt (3 min)**:
   - Use CLEAR framework
   - Instructors circulate to answer questions
   - Don't overthink - first draft is fine

3. **Generate & evaluate (3 min)**:
   - Put prompt into ChatGPT (or instructor's screen if no laptops)
   - Read output
   - Quick self-assessment: "What worked? What needs changing?"

4. **Share (1 min)**:
   - Ask 1-2 volunteers to share their output (read 20 seconds)
   - Quick instructor feedback: "Great job on [specific strength]"

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (2 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "CLEAR framework = clear prompts = better outputs"
- "Iteration is the process - 2-3 rounds gets you to great"
- "You just created real estate content in minutes that used to take 20-30 min"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "What was harder than expected?"
- "What was easier?"
- "What would you use this for first?"

**Transition to next module**:
- "You can now write solid prompts. But there's a secret weapon that takes outputs from good to great: context engineering. That's Module 6"

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 10 slides
  - Before/after hook
  - CLEAR framework overview
  - Each letter of CLEAR (5 slides with examples)
  - Full example prompt
  - Demo setup
  - Practice instructions
  - Key takeaways
- **Handouts**:
  - Structured Prompt Template (fillable worksheet)
  - 5 Real Estate Prompt Examples (listing, email, social, market update, objection response)
- **Templates**: Structured Prompt Worksheet
- **Technology**: ChatGPT access for all (or instructor screen for demo)

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't rush the framework teaching - it's the foundation
- Don't skip the demo iterations - seeing 3 rounds normalizes iteration
- Don't let practice run too long - 8 min is enough for first attempt

**Likely questions**:
- "Do I have to use all 5 CLEAR elements every time?" → "No, but most good prompts have at least 3-4"
- "What if I don't know the exact word count I want?" → "Give a range: 100-150 words"
- "Can I save prompts for later?" → "Yes - we'll cover that in context engineering"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress teaching to 10 min if needed (1-2 min per CLEAR element)
- CANNOT skip demo - it's the bridge to practice
- Can extend practice to 10 min if energy is high and people are engaged
- Can compress practice to 5 min if running behind (do demo only on instructor screen)

**Energy management**:
- This is post-break high energy - leverage it
- Make demo entertaining (react to outputs, joke about AI quirks)
- During practice, circulate actively, encourage participants, give real-time praise

---

## Module 6: Context Engineering

**Time Allocation**: 11:10-11:50 (40 minutes)
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Build a reusable "Voice & Tactics Card" with brand voice, objection responses, local nuance
- Understand how context improves AI outputs without rewriting prompts
- Apply context engineering to own business (create personal context card)
- See 2x improvement in output quality from context alone

**Prerequisites**: Module 5 complete (prompting fundamentals mastered)

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (3 min)
**Purpose**: Show dramatic quality improvement from context, create desire to learn technique
**Method**: Side-by-side demo
**Content**:
- Show same prompt twice:
  - **Version 1**: Prompt alone (decent output)
  - **Version 2**: Prompt + Context Card (much better output - matches brand voice, includes local details, handles objections)
- Statement: "Same prompt. One has a context card. Notice the difference? That's what you're building today"

#### 2. Core Teaching (12 min)
**Teaching method**: Framework + examples, building toward template

**Concept 1: What is Context Engineering? (3 min)**
- Definition: Feeding AI your specific details once, then reusing across all tasks
- Analogy: "It's like briefing a new assistant on how you work - do it once, benefits forever"
- Key insight: Context = voice + tactics + local knowledge + constraints
- Visual aid: Diagram showing "Generic AI" → + Context Card → "AI that sounds like YOU"

**Concept 2: The Voice & Tactics Card Template (9 min)**

**Section 1: Voice Pillars (2 min)**
- What to capture: 3-5 words/phrases that define your brand voice
- Real estate examples:
  - "Knowledgeable but never condescending"
  - "Data-driven and transparent"
  - "Warm, relationship-focused, community-oriented"
- Template field: "My brand voice is: [adjectives]"
- **Exercise**: Think of 3 words for your voice (write in notes)

**Section 2: Taboo Phrases & Style Rules (2 min)**
- What to capture: Phrases you never use, words to avoid, style preferences
- Real estate examples:
  - "Never: 'luxurious,' 'stunning,' 'motivated seller'"
  - "Always: Data over adjectives, specific over vague"
  - "Avoid: Exclamation points, all caps, emoji (unless social media)"
- Template field: "Never say: [list]. Always: [preferences]"

**Section 3: Objection Responses (3 min)**
- What to capture: Top 5-10 buyer/seller objections with your standard rebuttals
- Real estate examples:
  - Objection: "The market is too high to buy now"
  - Response: "I show data on rent vs. buy costs + equity building. Rates matter less than long-term value"
  - Objection: "Why should I list with you vs. discount broker?"
  - Response: "Full-service pricing = professional photos, staging, aggressive marketing, negotiation expertise. Data shows I sell 8% higher on average"
- Template field: "When clients say [objection], I respond with [your approach]"
- **Teaching note**: "AI can't make these up - you have to give them"

**Section 4: Local Nuance & Micro-Geography (2 min)**
- What to capture: Hyperlocal knowledge AI can't know
- Real estate examples:
  - "Williamson County schools are top-rated (9/10 average)"
  - "Franklin downtown is 15 min from most areas, major draw for dining/culture"
  - "Brentwood = upscale, family-oriented, HOAs common"
  - "Spring Hill = newer construction, commuter-friendly, growing fast"
- Template field: "Local details: [neighborhoods, schools, amenities, quirks]"

#### 3. Demonstration (10 min)
**What to demo**: Building a mini context card live, then using it
**Setup needed**: Template on screen, ChatGPT open
**Demo script**:

**Part 1: Build Mini Context Card (5 min)**
Instructor fills out template live, thinking aloud:
```
VOICE & TACTICS CARD - Ryan's Real Estate

Voice Pillars:
- Data-driven and transparent
- Warm but professional
- Community-focused, long-term relationships

Taboo Phrases:
- Never: "Stunning," "luxurious," "dream home," "motivated seller"
- Avoid: Overusing exclamation points, hype language
- Always: Lead with facts, specific over generic

Top Objections & Responses:
1. "Rates are too high" → Show rent vs. buy math, equity building
2. "Should I wait for prices to drop?" → Historical data, cost of waiting
3. "Why list with you?" → Track record (8% higher sale price), marketing strategy

Local Nuance:
- Williamson County schools: Top-rated, major buyer draw
- Franklin: 15 min to downtown, dining/culture hub
- Brentwood: Upscale, family-focused, strong HOAs
- Spring Hill: New construction, growing, commuter-friendly

Compliance:
- No Fair Housing violations (avoid family-oriented, safe neighborhood, etc.)
- All facts must be verifiable
- Disclose material defects accurately
```

**Part 2: Use Context Card (5 min)**
1. Show prompt WITHOUT context card:
   "Write an email responding to a buyer who says rates are too high and they should wait"
2. Generate output (decent but generic)
3. Show SAME prompt WITH context card:
   "Context: [paste Voice & Tactics Card]

   Now write an email responding to a buyer who says rates are too high and they should wait. Use my voice and objection response approach from the context card"
4. Generate new output (much better - uses instructor's specific rebuttal, matches voice)
5. Point out improvements: "See? It used MY data-driven approach, MY voice, MY local context"

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (12 min)
**Exercise**: Build Your Personal Voice & Tactics Card
**Format**: Individual work with template, pair share for feedback
**Materials needed**: Voice & Tactics Card template (handout or digital)
**Success criteria**: Complete at least 3 of 4 sections, test once with AI

**Process**:
1. **Fill out template (8 min)**:
   - Section 1: Voice Pillars (2 min) - 3-5 adjectives/phrases
   - Section 2: Taboo Phrases (2 min) - What you never say
   - Section 3: Objection Responses (3 min) - Pick top 3 objections
   - Section 4: Local Nuance (1 min) - Key local details
   - Instructors circulate, help participants who are stuck

2. **Pair & Share (3 min)**:
   - Turn to person next to you
   - Read your Voice Pillars and one objection response
   - Give each other feedback: "That sounds like you" or "Maybe make that more specific"

3. **Test it (1 min)**:
   - Instructor asks 1 volunteer to paste their card + a prompt into ChatGPT (on instructor screen if needed)
   - Generate output live
   - Quick evaluation: "Does this match your voice?"

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (3 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "Context card = 80% of quality, 20% of effort"
- "Build it once, use it forever (update quarterly)"
- "AI can't know your business - you have to tell it. This is how"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "What was hardest to capture?"
- "What surprised you about your own voice?"

**Transition to next module**:
- "You now have prompting skills AND context. That's the foundation. After lunch, we'll apply this to your specific jobs - the ones you identified this morning. See you at 1pm. Optional: I'll be here during lunch for questions or one-on-one help"

**ANNOUNCE**: "Rapid sharebacks in 10 minutes if anyone wants feedback on their outputs before lunch"

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 8 slides
  - Before/after hook (context card impact)
  - What is context engineering
  - Voice & Tactics Card template overview
  - Each section explained (4 slides)
  - Demo setup
  - Practice instructions
- **Handouts**:
  - Voice & Tactics Card Template (fillable, 1 page)
  - 3 Example Completed Cards (from different RE professionals)
- **Templates**: Voice & Tactics Card (Word doc + PDF)
- **Technology**: ChatGPT, template on screen

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't let participants overthink voice pillars - "good enough" is fine for v1
- Don't skip objection responses section - that's where huge value is
- Don't let this run long - lunch break needs to happen on time

**Likely questions**:
- "How long should this be?" → "1 page max, 200-300 words total. Concise is better"
- "Can I change it later?" → "Absolutely. This is v1, update as you learn"
- "Do I share this with AI every time?" → "Yes, paste at top of prompt. We'll show shortcuts later"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress teaching to 10 min (lighter on examples)
- CANNOT skip demo - it proves the value
- Can compress practice to 10 min if running behind (focus on 2 sections only)
- Must protect lunch break - 11:50 is hard stop

**Energy management**:
- This is last module before lunch - keep practical and engaging
- Pair & share adds social element, prevents isolation
- Promise "I'll be here at lunch for questions" - gives safety valve

---

## Module 7: Identify Top Jobs (Scan)

**Time Allocation**: 1:00-1:35 (35 minutes, post-lunch)
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Scan organization-wide jobs (beyond marketing) that AI can replace/augment
- Identify 2 pilot jobs per person using selection criteria
- Estimate time savings and success metrics for pilots
- Leave with clear action plan for implementation

**Prerequisites**: Lunch break complete, Module 6 complete (have prompting + context skills)

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (3 min)
**Purpose**: Energize post-lunch, shift from "AI for content" to "AI for workflows"
**Method**: Provocative reframe + visual
**Content**:
- Statement: "Most people think AI = marketing and social media. Wrong. The biggest wins are in the invisible work - the stuff that eats 2 hours of your day"
- Show visual: Pie chart of where agents spend time:
  - Admin/coordination: 25%
  - Lead follow-up: 20%
  - Marketing: 15%
  - Showings/meetings: 25%
  - Transactions: 15%
- Point out: "Look at that - 60% of your time is NOT face-to-face. That's where AI lives"

#### 2. Core Teaching (10 min)
**Teaching method**: Framework with examples, building toward personal job scan

**Concept 1: The Job Scan Framework (4 min)**
- Definition: Systematic review of every role/task in organization to find AI opportunities
- NOT just "what can AI do?" but "what should AI do?" (ROI-driven)
- Real estate job domains to scan:
  1. **Lead intake & triage**: First responses, qualification, CRM entry
  2. **Appointment setting**: Scheduling, reminders, confirmation
  3. **CRM hygiene**: Data entry, updates, tagging, notes
  4. **Transaction micro-tasks**: Checklist tracking, doc requests, status updates
  5. **Listing prep**: Copy, descriptions, social posts, email blasts
  6. **Market intelligence**: Report summaries, comp research, trend briefs
  7. **Customer service language**: FAQs, objection responses, follow-up sequences
  8. **Knowledge surfacing**: "What's our policy on X?", internal docs search
  9. **Ops coordination**: Vendor scheduling, inspection follow-up, closing coordination
- Key insight: "Jobs, not roles. Break it down to 10-15 minute tasks"

**Concept 2: Selection Criteria for Pilots (6 min)**
- Not all jobs are equal - use these 5 criteria to pick winners:

**Criterion 1: Minutes Per Week (2 min)**
- How much time does this consume weekly?
- Target: 30+ minutes/week minimum for pilot
- Examples:
  - Writing listing descriptions: 2 hours/week → Good candidate
  - Updating CRM notes: 1 hour/week → Good candidate
  - Negotiation strategy: 10 min/week → Too small

**Criterion 2: Repeatability (1 min)**
- Is this the same task over and over, or unique every time?
- Target: 70%+ similar across instances
- Examples:
  - Lead triage email: 90% repeatable → Good
  - Crisis management: 10% repeatable → Bad

**Criterion 3: Risk Level (1 min)**
- What happens if AI output is wrong?
- Target: Low to medium risk for pilots
- Examples:
  - Social media caption: Low risk → Good pilot
  - Contract terms: High risk → Not for AI alone

**Criterion 4: Measurability (1 min)**
- Can you measure time saved or quality improved?
- Target: Clear before/after metrics
- Examples:
  - Listing description time: Easy to measure (30 min → 5 min)
  - "Better client relationships": Hard to measure

**Criterion 5: Data Availability (1 min)**
- Do you have the inputs AI needs?
- Target: Facts already exist in MLS, CRM, or your head
- Examples:
  - Listing description: MLS data + photos = Available
  - Market trend analysis: Requires external research = Less available

**The 2-Pilot Rule**: Pick 2 jobs to pilot in next 30 days. One content job (listing, email). One workflow job (triage, CRM).

#### 3. Demonstration (7 min)
**What to demo**: Job scan process for one fictional agent, then pilot selection
**Setup needed**: Job scan worksheet on screen
**Demo script**:

**Part 1: Job Identification (3 min)**
Instructor fills out fictional agent's job list:
```
Agent: Sarah, 15 transactions/year, solo agent

Current Jobs (time drains):
1. Lead triage emails - 2 hours/week
2. Listing descriptions - 1.5 hours/week
3. Social media posts - 1 hour/week
4. Market update emails - 1 hour/week
5. CRM data entry - 1 hour/week
6. Showing feedback summaries - 30 min/week
7. Transaction checklists - 45 min/week
8. Client gift notes - 15 min/week
```

**Part 2: Apply Selection Criteria (3 min)**
Instructor scores each job:
```
Job: Lead triage emails
- Minutes/week: 2 hours (120 min) ✓
- Repeatability: 80% same questions ✓
- Risk: Low (you review before sending) ✓
- Measurability: Yes (time saved) ✓
- Data available: Yes (CRM, website form) ✓
Score: 5/5 → PILOT CANDIDATE

Job: Listing descriptions
- Minutes/week: 1.5 hours (90 min) ✓
- Repeatability: 70% similar ✓
- Risk: Low-medium (facts need verification) ✓
- Measurability: Yes (time saved) ✓
- Data available: Yes (MLS, photos) ✓
Score: 5/5 → PILOT CANDIDATE

Job: Client gift notes
- Minutes/week: 15 min ✗ (too small)
Score: LOW PRIORITY
```

**Part 3: Pick 2 Pilots (1 min)**
Instructor announces:
"Sarah's pilots: (1) Lead triage emails (2 hrs/week savings), (2) Listing descriptions (1.5 hrs/week savings). Total: 3.5 hours back per week"

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (12 min)
**Exercise**: Personal Job Scan & Pilot Selection
**Format**: Individual work with worksheet, pair for validation
**Materials needed**: Job Scan Worksheet (printed or digital)
**Success criteria**: Identify 8-10 jobs, select 2 pilots with success metrics

**Process**:
1. **List your jobs (4 min)**:
   - Brainstorm 8-10 tasks that consume time weekly
   - Don't filter yet - just capture
   - Use the 9 domains from teaching as prompts
   - Instructors circulate, help people who are stuck

2. **Score & prioritize (4 min)**:
   - Apply 5 criteria to top 5 jobs (quick gut-check, not perfect)
   - Circle 2-3 that score highest

3. **Pick 2 pilots + metrics (2 min)**:
   - Choose 1 content job, 1 workflow job (or both content if that's where pain is)
   - Write success metric:
     - Pilot 1: [Job name] - [Time saved/week] - [Quality measure]
     - Pilot 2: [Job name] - [Time saved/week] - [Quality measure]
   - Example: "Listing descriptions - 1 hour/week saved - Client says 'this sounds like me'"

4. **Pair & share (2 min)**:
   - Turn to person next to you
   - Share your 2 pilots
   - Partner asks: "How will you measure success?"

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (3 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "You just did strategic AI planning - most people skip this and waste time on wrong tasks"
- "2 pilots, 30 days. That's how you learn what works"
- "Don't pilot 10 things - focus, measure, iterate"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "How many picked content jobs for pilot 1?" (show of hands)
- "How many picked workflow jobs?" (show of hands)
- "Who's committing to trying this next week?" (all hands - public commitment)

**Transition to next module**:
- "You know what to automate. Now we need to pick the right tools without drowning in options. Module 8: Finding Tools (keeping the stack tiny)"

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 6 slides
  - Pie chart hook (where time goes)
  - 9 Job domains list
  - 5 Selection criteria
  - Demo: Job scan example
  - Practice instructions
  - Key takeaways
- **Handouts**:
  - Job Scan Worksheet (2-page, fillable)
  - Selection Criteria Quick Reference (laminated card)
- **Templates**: Job Scan Worksheet (Excel or PDF)
- **Technology**: Projector for demo

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't let participants pick too many pilots - 2 max
- Don't let them pick high-risk jobs first (contract review, legal advice)
- Don't skip measurement discussion - unmeasured pilots rarely get adopted

**Likely questions**:
- "Can I pilot 3 jobs?" → "No. 2 max. Focus beats breadth"
- "What if my pilot fails?" → "That's data. Learn and pick different job"
- "Should I tell my broker?" → "Yes, especially if it affects workflows with others"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress teaching to 8 min (lighter examples)
- CANNOT skip demo - it shows the thinking process
- Can compress practice to 10 min (speed up pair share)
- Can extend practice to 15 min if energy is high

**Energy management**:
- Post-lunch slump is real - keep this interactive and personal
- Use movement: stand up to fill out worksheet, walk to partner
- Celebrate good pilot choices out loud: "Great pick on lead triage!"

---

## Module 8: Finding Tools (Tiny Stack)

**Time Allocation**: 1:35-2:00 (25 minutes)
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Choose AI tools by job-to-be-done (not features)
- Apply 5 filters to avoid tool bloat (saves minutes now, editable, privacy, cost, integrates)
- Know core tool stack: ChatGPT vs. Claude vs. specialized RE tools
- Avoid "shiny object syndrome" and tool overwhelm

**Prerequisites**: Module 7 complete (know which jobs to automate)

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (2 min)
**Purpose**: Create urgency around focus, avoid tool overwhelm
**Method**: Cautionary story + visual
**Content**:
- Story: "I've seen agents sign up for 12 AI tools, pay $300/month total, and use none of them. Why? Tool overload. Decision fatigue. No clear job match"
- Visual: Slide showing "AI Tools for Real Estate" with 50+ logos
- Statement: "Here's the rule: Tiny stack beats big stack. 2-3 tools you use daily > 10 tools you forget exist"

#### 2. Core Teaching (10 min)
**Teaching method**: Decision framework + tool comparison

**Concept 1: Job-to-Be-Done Tool Selection (3 min)**
- Principle: Start with job, THEN find tool. Never start with tool.
- Wrong approach: "This AI tool looks cool, what can I use it for?"
- Right approach: "I need to write listing descriptions faster. What tool does that best?"
- Example job-to-tool mapping:
  - Job: Listing descriptions → Tool: ChatGPT or Claude
  - Job: Virtual staging photos → Tool: Virtual Staging AI
  - Job: Lead triage automation → Tool: CRM with AI (Follow Up Boss, etc.)
  - Job: Email campaign copy → Tool: ChatGPT + your context card

**Concept 2: The 5 Filters (5 min)**
- Don't evaluate tools on features - use these 5 filters:

**Filter 1: Saves Minutes Now (1 min)**
- Question: "Does this save time in the first week, or require months of setup?"
- Test: Can you get value in first session?
- Examples:
  - ChatGPT for content: YES (immediate)
  - Custom GPT with CRM integration: NO (requires dev work)

**Filter 2: Easy to Edit (1 min)**
- Question: "Can I quickly fix AI output, or is it locked/hard to modify?"
- Test: Can you copy/paste and revise?
- Examples:
  - Text-based tools: YES (edit in Word/Docs)
  - Automated video tools: MAYBE (depends on export options)

**Filter 3: Privacy Posture (1 min)**
- Question: "Where does my data go? Can clients' PII be exposed?"
- Test: Read terms of service, check for business/enterprise tier
- Examples:
  - ChatGPT free: NO (trains on your data)
  - ChatGPT Plus/Teams: YES (opt-out available)
  - Claude Pro: YES (doesn't train on conversations)

**Filter 4: Cost Clarity (1 min)**
- Question: "Is pricing transparent and affordable, or hidden/enterprise-only?"
- Test: Can you see pricing page? Is it <$50/month?
- Examples:
  - ChatGPT Plus: $20/month → CLEAR
  - "Contact sales for quote" → UNCLEAR (usually expensive)

**Filter 5: Integrates with Workflow (1 min)**
- Question: "Does this fit my current tools, or require replacing everything?"
- Test: Can you copy/paste outputs into existing systems?
- Examples:
  - ChatGPT → Copy to MLS: YES (easy)
  - New CRM that requires migration: NO (too disruptive for pilot)

**Concept 3: Core Tool Stack (2 min)**
- Recommended minimal stack for real estate pros:
  - **Tier 1 (Essential)**: ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) or Claude Pro ($20/mo)
    - Use for: All text tasks (listings, emails, social, summaries)
  - **Tier 2 (Optional)**: Specialized tools only if general AI doesn't meet need
    - Virtual staging: Virtual Staging AI ($30-50/project)
    - Video: Descript or Riverside for transcription/editing
    - CRM AI: Built into Follow Up Boss, LionDesk, etc. (if you already use them)
  - **Tier 3 (Avoid)**: Random point solutions that duplicate general AI

#### 3. Demonstration (5 min)
**What to demo**: Tool comparison for one job (listing descriptions)
**Setup needed**: ChatGPT and Claude open in tabs
**Demo script**:

**Job**: Write listing description

**Tool Option 1: ChatGPT (2 min)**
1. Show prompt from earlier module
2. Generate listing description
3. Point out: "Fast, good, easy to edit, familiar interface"
4. Pro: Most widely used, great for general tasks
5. Con: Can be generic without good context card

**Tool Option 2: Claude (2 min)**
1. Show SAME prompt
2. Generate listing description
3. Point out: "Often more sophisticated, better at matching voice/tone"
4. Pro: Longer context window (better for big documents), strong writing
5. Con: Rate limits on free tier can be annoying

**Decision Framework Applied (1 min)**
- Saves minutes now? Both: YES
- Easy to edit? Both: YES (copy/paste)
- Privacy? Both: YES (on paid tiers)
- Cost clarity? Both: YES ($20/month)
- Integrates? Both: YES (copy to MLS)
- **Conclusion**: "Either works. Pick one, use it for 30 days. Don't use both for same task"

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (5 min)
**Exercise**: Tool Selection for Your 2 Pilots
**Format**: Individual work with decision tree
**Materials needed**: Tool Selection Cheat Sheet (handout)
**Success criteria**: Choose 1-2 tools to pilot with, justify with filters

**Process**:
1. **Review your 2 pilots from Module 7 (1 min)**:
   - Pilot 1: [Job name]
   - Pilot 2: [Job name]

2. **Match to tools (3 min)**:
   - Use cheat sheet to find recommended tools for each job type
   - Apply 5 filters mentally (quick gut-check)
   - Write down: "For Pilot 1, I'll use [Tool]. For Pilot 2, I'll use [Tool]"
   - Default recommendation for most: "ChatGPT Plus for both"

3. **Pair validation (1 min)**:
   - Turn to partner
   - Share your tool choices
   - Partner asks: "Does that tool do what you need?"

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (3 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "Tiny stack: 1-2 tools you master > 10 tools you dabble with"
- "Start with ChatGPT or Claude for 90% of tasks. Add specialized tools only if needed"
- "Filter for now-value, not future promises"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "Who's using ChatGPT already?" (show of hands)
- "Who's using Claude?" (show of hands)
- "Who's overwhelmed by tool options?" (validate feeling, reinforce tiny stack)

**Transition to next module**:
- "You have jobs, tools, and skills. But there's one critical topic before we build systems: security. AI fraud is real, and it's targeting real estate. That's Module 9 after the break"

**ANNOUNCE**: "10-minute break. Back at 2:10 for AI security"

- **Technology**: ChatGPT and Claude open in browser

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't spend too much time on exotic tools - focus on ChatGPT/Claude
- Don't let participants get distracted by "what about [niche tool X]?" - redirect to filters
- Don't skip privacy discussion - it's critical for compliance

**Likely questions**:
- "Should I get ChatGPT Plus or just use free?" → "Plus if you'll use it 3+ times/week. Free for experimentation"
- "What about [specific RE tool X]?" → "Apply the 5 filters. If it passes, try it. Most don't beat general AI"
- "Do I need both ChatGPT and Claude?" → "No. Pick one for 30 days. You can explore other later"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress teaching to 8 min (lighter on examples)
- CANNOT skip demo comparison - it's the clearest teaching moment
- Can skip practice if running behind (move tool selection to homework)
- Must protect break - 2:00 is hard stop for 10-min break

**Energy management**:
- This is pre-break - keep brisk and practical
- Use humor about tool overwhelm (everyone relates)
- End on empowering note: "You now know more about tool selection than 90% of agents"

## Module 9: AI Security & Fraud Awareness

**Time Allocation**: 2:10-2:40 (30 minutes, post-break)
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Identify 4 primary AI fraud vectors in real estate (text, voice, image, document)
- Apply verification protocols for wire transfers and identity
- Recognize red flags in AI-generated content (phishing, deepfakes, fake listings)
- Implement "verify via known channel" standard operating procedure
- Protect client data when using AI tools

**Prerequisites**: Module 8 complete, 10-min break complete

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (3 min)
**Purpose**: Create urgency and fear (appropriate for security topic)
**Method**: Shocking statistics + real case study
**Content**:
- Statistics slide: "$500M stolen via real estate wire fraud in 2024. $72K median loss per incident"
- Case study teaser: "California couple lost $720,000 on a Zoom call with their attorney. Except it wasn't their attorney - it was a deepfake"
- Statement: "AI makes fraud easier, faster, and more convincing. You need to know how to spot it and stop it"

#### 2. Core Teaching (15 min)
**Teaching method**: Threat → Example → Verification protocol (repeated for each vector)

**Fraud Vector 1: Wire Transfer Phishing (4 min)**
- **Threat**: Email impersonating title company with "updated" wire instructions
- **How AI enhances it**: Emails are perfectly written, contextually aware, use correct names/dates
- **Real case**: West Virginia buyer lost $255K following email instructions (source: fraud_landscape.md)
- **Red flags**:
  - Slight domain misspelling (titIe.com vs title.com)
  - Urgency language ("wire today or closing delayed")
  - Wire instructions via email alone (never acceptable)
- **Verification protocol**:
  1. NEVER accept wire instructions via email alone
  2. Call title company using number from title commitment (NOT email)
  3. Verbally confirm: account number, routing, bank name, amount
  4. Establish code word with title officer
  5. If ANY changes: repeat entire protocol
- Visual aid: Flowchart showing "Receive wire instructions → Call known number → Verify → Send wire"

**Fraud Vector 2: Voice Cloning (4 min)**
- **Threat**: Phone call from "broker" or "attorney" with AI-cloned voice requesting urgent action
- **How AI enhances it**: Voice cloning requires only 3-30 seconds of audio (from YouTube, social media)
- **Real case**: NFL rookie lost $240K to cloned bank employee voice (source: fraud_landscape.md)
- **Red flags**:
  - Unexpected call requesting wire transfer or credential changes
  - Urgency ("do this now")
  - Caller resists verification ("no time to call back")
- **Verification protocol**:
  1. Never act on incoming calls requesting financial transactions
  2. Hang up and call known number independently
  3. Use pre-established code word
  4. If "urgent": it's probably fraud (real urgency allows 5-min verification)
- Visual aid: Side-by-side showing "Incoming call + request" vs. "Hang up + Call back"

**Fraud Vector 3: Deepfake Video / Fake Listings (4 min)**
- **Threat 3A: Deepfake video on remote closing**
  - **How**: Fraudster impersonates seller/buyer on Zoom/video call
  - **Real case**: Florida title company caught deepfake when "seller" couldn't raise hand on command
  - **Verification protocol**:
    1. Request specific physical actions ("wave your hand," "turn your head left")
    2. Out-of-band verification via phone to known number
    3. For high-value transactions: in-person closing preferred

- **Threat 3B: AI-generated fake listings**
  - **How**: Completely fake properties with AI-generated photos and copy
  - **Risk**: Renters/buyers pay deposits on properties that don't exist or aren't for sale
  - **Red flags**:
    - Price significantly below market
    - Landlord always "out of town," can't show in person
    - Photos too perfect, repeated patterns, odd lighting
    - Pressure to pay before viewing
  - **Verification protocol**:
    1. Reverse image search on photos
    2. Verify listing with MLS (for sales) or property owner (for rentals)
    3. Always view property in person before paying
    4. Never wire money to individual (only escrow/title company)

**Fraud Vector 4: Document Forgery (3 min)**
- **Threat**: Forged deeds, fake payoff statements, altered contracts
- **How AI enhances it**: AI generates official-looking documents, forges signatures
- **Real case**: Texas scheme using falsified deeds/payoff statements ($350K loss)
- **Red flags**:
  - Document formatting inconsistencies
  - Signature variations
  - Unexpected document sources
- **Verification protocol**:
  1. Verify notary directly (call notary, check commission)
  2. Confirm recording with county clerk
  3. Cross-reference with known documents
  4. For critical docs: request originals via known channel

**Cross-Cutting Principle: Verify Via Known Channel**
- **Golden rule**: Any request for money or credentials → verify via known channel BEFORE acting
- **Known channel** = phone number from business card, title commitment, official website (NOT from email/text)
- Visual aid: "Email request → STOP → Call known number → Verify → Proceed"

#### 3. Demonstration (5 min)
**What to demo**: Red flag identification in phishing email + proper verification
**Setup needed**: Sample phishing email on screen (anonymized real example)
**Demo script**:

**Part 1: Spot the Red Flags (3 min)**
1. Display phishing email on screen:
   ```
   From: Sarah Johnson <sjohnson@titIecompany.com>
   Subject: URGENT: Updated Wire Instructions - Closing Tomorrow

   Hi [Agent Name],

   Due to a last-minute bank change, please use these updated wire instructions for the closing on 123 Main Street tomorrow:

   Account: 9876543210
   Routing: 123456789
   Bank: First National Trust
   Amount: $425,000

   Please confirm receipt and wire today to avoid delays.

   Thanks,
   Sarah Johnson
   Senior Escrow Officer
   Title Company LLC
   ```

2. Ask participants: "What red flags do you see?" (take 3-4 callouts)

3. Instructor reveals red flags:
   - Domain: "titIe" (capital I instead of lowercase L)
   - Subject line urgency: "URGENT"
   - Pressure: "wire today to avoid delays"
   - Wire instructions via email alone
   - Sender known? (would need to verify)

**Part 2: Proper Response (2 min)**
Instructor demonstrates:
1. "I do NOT reply to this email or click any links"
2. "I find title company number from my title commitment (show prop document)"
3. "I call that number: [picks up phone, pretends to dial]"
4. "I ask for Sarah Johnson directly"
5. "I say: 'I received an email about updated wire instructions. Can you confirm these are correct? I'll read them back...'"
6. "If they say 'we didn't send that email' → fraud confirmed, everyone notified"

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (5 min)
**Exercise**: Red Flag Identification Challenge
**Format**: Group activity with 4 scenarios
**Materials needed**: Scenario cards (printed or on screen)
**Success criteria**: Correctly identify fraud vector and proper response for each scenario

**Process**:
1. **Present 4 scenarios (4 min, 1 min each)**:

   **Scenario A**: "You receive a text from your broker's number asking you to send client info urgently"
   - Fraud vector? (Voice/text impersonation or phone number spoofing)
   - Response? (Call broker's known number to verify)

   **Scenario B**: "A listing photo shows a kitchen that looks perfect but the baseboards curve strangely"
   - Fraud vector? (AI-generated or manipulated image)
   - Response? (Request additional photos, visit property, reverse image search)

   **Scenario C**: "You're on a video call with a client, but their responses seem delayed and generic"
   - Fraud vector? (Deepfake video)
   - Response? (Request specific physical action, call known number to verify)

   **Scenario D**: "Email from title company says wire instructions haven't changed, just confirming"
   - Fraud vector? (Phishing attempting to appear legitimate)
   - Response? (Still verify via known channel - even "no change" emails can be spoofed)

2. **Group callouts (1 min)**: Quick answers from participants, instructor confirms

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (2 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "If it involves money or client data → verify via known channel. Always"
- "AI makes fraud convincing. Your verification protocol is your defense"
- "When in doubt: call. 5 minutes of verification > $72K loss"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "Have you or anyone you know experienced attempted fraud?" (share if comfortable)
- "What's your biggest security concern?"

**Transition to next module**:
- "You know what to watch for. Now let's use AI safely and effectively with desktop tools that make this even easier. Module 10"

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 10 slides

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't make this too scary - balance fear with empowerment (you can prevent this)
- Don't skip verification protocols - they're the actionable takeaway
- Don't let Q&A derail into "war stories" - keep on schedule

**Likely questions**:
- "How do I know if my email is compromised?" → "Check sent folder for messages you didn't send, enable MFA immediately"
- "Should I tell my clients about this?" → "Yes, especially about wire fraud. Provide one-pager"
- "What if title company actually does send wire instructions via email?" → "Still call to verify. Every. Time"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress teaching to 12 min (lighter on case study details)
- CANNOT skip demo - email analysis is critical teaching moment
- Can compress practice to 3 min (2 scenarios instead of 4)
- Can extend to 35 min if room is engaged (but protect Module 10 time)

**Energy management**:
- This is serious content - match tone (concerned but not panicked)
- Use real cases for credibility
- End on empowering note: "You now know more than 90% of agents"

---

## Module 10: Desktop AI + Connectors

**Time Allocation**: 2:40-3:25 (45 minutes)
**Learning Outcomes**:
- Use desktop AI app (ChatGPT desktop, Claude desktop, or similar) for file/screenshot workflows
- Understand "connectors" in plain English (MCP = tools that let AI read files)
- Apply desktop AI to real estate tasks (summarize PDFs, extract photo details, condense threads)
- Build 3 file-based workflows participants can use Monday

**Prerequisites**: Module 9 complete (security awareness in place)

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (3 min)
**Purpose**: Show power of file-based AI workflows vs. copy/paste
**Method**: Before/after comparison
**Content**:
- **Before**: "You have a 40-page market report PDF. To get AI to summarize it, you'd have to copy/paste pages into ChatGPT. Tedious and error-prone"
- **After**: "With desktop AI, you drop the PDF and say 'summarize this in 5 bullets for sellers.' Done in 10 seconds"
- Statement: "Desktop AI + connectors = AI that reads your files, screenshots, even audio notes. Let's learn 3 workflows you'll use constantly"

#### 2. Core Teaching (12 min)
**Teaching method**: Concept explanation + workflow templates

- **Connectors (MCP in plain English)**: Plugins that let AI read different file types
  - Text files (Word, PDF, emails)
  - Images (photos, screenshots, listing images)
  - Spreadsheets (CSV, Excel)
  - Audio (voice notes, meeting recordings)
- **Why this matters**: Instead of copy/paste, you drop file → AI processes → you get output
- Visual aid: Diagram showing "File → AI → Output" vs. "Copy/Paste → AI → Output"

**Concept 2: Core Desktop AI Capabilities (4 min)**
- **Capability 1: PDF/Document Summarization**
  - Use case: Market reports, CMAs, inspection reports, HOA docs

   - "Open question: Seller covering termite treatment?"
   - "Action: Agent to confirm with seller by 3/12"
   - "Critical date: Contingency period ends 3/20"
6. Point out: "I can forward this summary to all parties - everyone's aligned in seconds"
7. Show iteration: "Draft a 3-line email to seller summarizing action items"
8. Generate email draft

**Key Teaching Moment After Demos**:
"Did you see the pattern? Drop file → Specific prompt → Usable output → Quick iteration. That's desktop AI workflows"

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (7 min)
**Exercise**: Try Desktop AI Workflow (Guided)
**Format**: Individual or pairs (depending on device availability)
**Materials needed**: Participants' own files OR instructor-provided sample files
**Success criteria**: Successfully drop file and generate one output

**Process**:
1. **Setup (1 min)**:
   - If participants have laptops with ChatGPT/Claude: work on own device
   - If not: instructor continues live demo with volunteer prompts

2. **Guided workflow (5 min)**:
   - Choose one workflow:
     - Option A: Drop a PDF (market report, inspection, HOA docs) → Get summary
     - Option B: Drop 3-5 photos (listing photos, property images) → Get feature list
     - Option C: Drop screenshot of email → Get action items
   - Instructor walks through step-by-step with participants
   - Generate outputs together

3. **Share results (1 min)**:
   - 2-3 volunteers read their outputs aloud
   - Instructor points out quality: "See how specific that was?"

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (3 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "Desktop AI + files = 10-20 min saved per workflow"
- "Drop file → Specific prompt → Output → Iterate. That's the pattern"
- "You'll use this most for: market summaries, photo analysis, email condensing"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "Which workflow will you use first?"
- "What files do you have that you'd love to drop into AI?"

**Transition to next module**:
- "You now have all the skills and tools. Final step: build a complete system for one pilot job. That's the capstone. Module 11"

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 8 slides
  - Before/after hook
  - What are desktop AI + connectors
  - 3 core capabilities
  - 3 workflows with templates
  - Demo setup (minimal - mostly live)
  - Practice instructions
  - Key takeaways
- **Handouts**:
  - Desktop AI Quick-Use Card (hotkey, workflow templates, command patterns)

- **Templates**: Workflow prompt templates
- **Technology**:
  - ChatGPT desktop app or Claude desktop app
  - Sample files: market report PDF, 10 listing photos, email screenshot
  - Screen sharing/projection

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't get too technical on "what is MCP" - keep it plain English ("connectors let AI read files")
- Don't skip live demos - this module is demo-heavy by design
- Don't let participants get stuck on installation if they don't have desktop app - use instructor screen

**Likely questions**:
- "Do I need to install software?" → "Desktop apps are optional. You can do most of this in web browser by copy/pasting or uploading files"
- "Where do my files go?" → "Processed by AI, not stored permanently if you're using ChatGPT Plus/Claude Pro with privacy settings"
- "Can AI read my MLS access?" → "No. AI only sees files you explicitly share"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress teaching to 10 min (lighter examples)
- CANNOT significantly shorten demos - they're the core value of this module
- Can skip hands-on practice if running behind (provide templates for homework)
- Can extend to 50 min if high engagement and device availability

**Energy management**:
- This is late-day content but high-value "wow factor" keeps energy up
- Demos are entertaining - use them to re-energize room
- Encourage "oohs" and reactions when outputs are good

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't let participants pick NEW jobs - must be one of their 2 pilots from Module 7
- Don't let people get stuck on perfection - "good enough for v1" is the goal
- Don't skip measurement discussion - unmeasured systems don't get used

**Likely questions**:
- "Can I build systems for both pilots?" → "Not in this time. Pick one now, build second one at home using same process"
- "What if my output isn't perfect?" → "Iterate once. If still not perfect, that's data for refinement"
- "Should I share this system with my team?" → "Yes, if it works for you. Test first"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress teaching to 4 min if needed
- CANNOT significantly shorten practice - it's the capstone deliverable
- Can extend practice to 20 min if people are productive
- Must protect Module 12 (final 5 min) - it's the commitment/wrap

**Energy management**:
- This is final stretch - keep energy up with encouragement
- Circulate actively, celebrate good systems out loud
- Use humor: "You're building AI systems now - you're basically developers"
- End on high note: "You did it!"

- Provide feedback for workshop improvement
- Leave with clear action plan and confidence

**Prerequisites**: All modules complete, capstone system built

---

### Content Flow

#### 1. Hook / Opening (1 min)
**Purpose**: Celebrate progress, create momentum for action
**Method**: Reflection + recognition
**Content**:
- Statement: "Look at what you did today. You learned AI fundamentals, built prompts, created a context card, scanned your workflows, picked tools, mastered security, and shipped a working system. That's not theory - that's execution"
- Recognition: "You're now in the top 10% of real estate professionals on AI capability. The question is: will you use it?"

#### 2. Core Teaching (0 min)
**N/A** - No new teaching, just commitments and resources

#### 3. Demonstration (0 min)
**N/A** - No demo

#### 4. Hands-On Practice (3 min)
**Exercise**: Public Commitment & Resource Access
**Format**: Whole group + individual action
**Materials needed**: Commitment card (or digital form), resource QR code
**Success criteria**: Every participant states commitment and has access to resources

**Process**:

**Part 1: Public Commitment (2 min)**
- Instructor: "I want everyone to make one commitment for this week"
- Prompt: "In the next 7 days, I will use my AI system for [your pilot job] at least [3] times"
- Method: Quick whip-around (if small group <15 people):
  - Each person says out loud: "I'll use AI for [listing descriptions / email responses / etc.] 3 times this week"
- Method: Written commitment (if large group >15 people):
  - Write commitment on card
  - Hold up card (visual commitment)
  - Take photo of your commitment (accountability)

**Part 2: Resource Access (1 min)**
- Show slide with QR code
- QR code links to resource hub with:
  - All handouts (PDF downloads)
  - Recorded demos (if recorded)
  - Prompt library (25+ prompts)
  - Tool links
  - Instructor contact for questions
  - 30-day implementation challenge
- Everyone scans QR code or writes down URL

#### 5. Debrief & Transition (1 min)
**Key takeaways**:
- "You have the skills. You have the system. Now execute"
- "Use it 3 times this week. By week 3, it'll be habit"
- "I'm here if you need help - email/text in the resources"

**Q&A prompts**:
- "Any final questions before we close?"

**Closing statement**:
- "Thank you for your energy and engagement today. AI is not the future - it's now. You're ready. Go use it"
- **Optional**: Provide CE credit certificates if applicable

---

### Materials Required
- **Slides**: 3 slides
  - Progress reflection/recognition
  - Public commitment prompt
  - Resource QR code + closing
- **Handouts**:
  - Commitment card (if not digital)
  - Resource one-pager with QR code and URL
  - Certificate of completion (if applicable for CE credit)
- **Templates**: None
- **Technology**: QR code display, projector

---

### Instructor Notes
**Common pitfalls**:
- Don't let this run long - 4:00 is hard stop
- Don't skip public commitment - it increases follow-through significantly
- Don't forget to share contact info - post-workshop support matters

**Likely questions**:
- "Can I email you questions later?" → "Yes, contact info in resources"
- "Is there a follow-up session?" → Answer based on your offering (e.g., "Yes, 30-day check-in")
- "Can I share these materials with my team?" → "Yes, all handouts are yours to use"

**Timing flexibility**:
- Can compress to 3 minutes if absolutely necessary
- CANNOT skip commitment - it's the behavior change trigger
- Can extend to 7 minutes for larger group commitments or emotional closing

**Energy management**:
- This is the emotional high point - match the energy
- Make it celebratory, not rushed
- End on inspiration: "You can do this"

## Module Sequencing & Dependencies

### How Modules Build on Each Other

**Foundation Layer (Modules 1-3)**:
- Module 1 → Module 2: Framing enables open sharing of pain points
- Module 2 → Module 3: Pain points inform which mental models to emphasize
- Module 3 → Module 4: Mental models frame how to think about capabilities/limitations

**Skills Layer (Modules 4-6)**:
- Module 4 → Module 5: Understanding AI capabilities informs what to prompt for
- Module 5 → Module 6: Basic prompting must be learned before advanced context engineering
- Module 6 → Module 7: Context card is built, ready to apply to jobs

**Application Layer (Modules 7-10)**:
- Module 7 → Module 8: Jobs identified before tools selected (job-to-tool, not tool-to-job)
- Module 8 → Module 9: Tools chosen, now understand how to use safely
- Module 9 → Module 10: Security awareness in place before file-handling workflows
- Module 10 → Module 11: All skills taught, ready for capstone synthesis

**Synthesis Layer (Modules 11-12)**:
- Module 11: Integrates all prior modules into one working system
- Module 12: Commitment to use the system, ensuring learning → action

### Critical Dependencies (Cannot Reorder)

**MUST come before**:
- Module 3 (Mental Models) BEFORE Module 4 (What AI Is) - mental models frame interpretation
- Module 5 (Prompting) BEFORE Module 6 (Context) - basic before advanced
- Module 7 (Jobs) BEFORE Module 8 (Tools) - need-based tool selection requires knowing needs
- Module 9 (Security) BEFORE Module 10 (Desktop AI) - security awareness before file handling
- Modules 5-10 ALL BEFORE Module 11 (Capstone) - capstone requires all skills

**Can potentially swap**:
- Module 2 (Q&A Pulse) and Module 3 (Mental Models) - minor flexibility
- Module 9 (Security) and Module 10 (Desktop AI) - but current order is optimal

## Energy Management Plan

### Energy Arc Across the Day

**9:00-10:25 (High Energy - Peak Performance)**
- **Modules 1-4**: Foundation and conceptual learning
- Strategy: Leverage fresh morning minds for mental models and concepts
- Keep pace brisk, engagement high

**10:25-10:35 (Recovery)**
- **First Break**: Essential reset before hands-on work

**10:35-11:50 (High Energy - Productive)**
- **Modules 5-6**: Skills building with immediate application
- Strategy: Post-break energy for first hands-on practice
- Build confidence through quick wins

**11:50-1:00 (Low Energy - Lunch)**
- **Lunch Break**: Longest break, includes optional office hours
- Strategy: Provide space for informal questions and rest

**1:00-2:00 (Medium Energy - Rebuilding)**
- **Module 7**: Interactive job scan (post-lunch slump management)
- Strategy: Use collaborative exercise to re-engage
- Movement and discussion combat food coma

**2:00-2:10 (Recovery)**
- **Second Break**: Quick reset before security content

**2:10-3:25 (Medium-High Energy - Sustained Focus)**
- **Modules 8-10**: Tool selection, security, desktop workflows
- Strategy: Mix serious (security) with exciting (desktop demos)
- Demos provide passive engagement when energy dips

**3:25-4:00 (Final Push - Sprint Energy)**
- **Modules 11-12**: Capstone and commitments
- Strategy: Create urgency and excitement for final build
- End on inspirational high note

### Energy Management Tactics by Module

**High-Engagement Modules** (Combat low energy):
- Module 2: Q&A Pulse (interactive, not passive)
- Module 7: Job Scan (movement, pair work)
- Module 10: Desktop AI (exciting demos)

**Passive-Friendly Modules** (When energy is low):
- Module 3: Mental Models (can absorb conceptually)
- Module 9: Security (serious tone, story-driven)

**Energizing Modules** (Boost energy):
- Module 5: Prompting (first real hands-on success)
- Module 11: Capstone (final sprint, tangible output)
- Module 12: Commitments (celebration, inspiration)

### Break Strategy

**Break 1 (10:25-10:35, 10 min)**:
- Purpose: Physical reset before first hands-on work
- Timing: After conceptual modules, before skill-building
- Instructor action: Distribute handouts during break

**Break 2 (11:50-1:00, 70 min lunch)**:
- Purpose: Rest, refuel, optional coaching
- Timing: After morning skill-building, before application modules
- Instructor action: Stay available for questions, one-on-one help

**Break 3 (2:00-2:10, 10 min)**:
- Purpose: Mental reset before security content
- Timing: Between tool selection and security (topic shift)
- Instructor action: Prep security demos during break

### Contingency: Energy Crash Management

**If post-lunch energy is very low (1:00-2:00)**:
- Shorten Module 7 (Job Scan) to 30 minutes
- Add 5-minute stand-up stretch break
- Increase interactivity (more pair work, less lecture)

**If late-day fatigue hits hard (3:00+)**:
- Compress Module 10 (Desktop AI) demos (show 2 workflows instead of 3)
- Extend break before capstone to 15 minutes
- Shorten Module 11 (Capstone) to 25 minutes, reduce to 1 output instead of 2

## Document End

**Blueprint Status**: Complete (all 12 modules designed)
**Total Pages**: ~60+ pages of detailed curriculum design
**Ready for Phase 3**: Content creation (slides, handouts, templates)

**Next Steps**:
1. Produce slide decks (use blueprint content)
2. Create all handouts and templates
3. Source/create sample files for demos
4. Record backup demos
5. Test full workshop run-through (timing validation)
6. Prepare instructor guide (this blueprint + facilitation tips)

**Notes for Instructor**:
- This blueprint is comprehensive but flexible - adjust timing based on real-time room energy
- The 70/30 practice/teaching ratio is sacred - protect hands-on time
- Security (Module 9) is non-negotiable - don't skip or rush
- Capstone (Module 11) is the deliverable - participants must leave with a working system
- Commitment (Module 12) drives behavior change - make it public and specific

**Questions for Workshop Sponsor (WCAR)**:
- CE credit: How many hours, what documentation needed?
- Room setup: Can we get tables (not lecture seating)?
- Technology: Is WiFi reliable enough for 20-30 concurrent users?
- Materials: Print handouts or provide digital only?
- Follow-up: Permission to email participants post-workshop?
