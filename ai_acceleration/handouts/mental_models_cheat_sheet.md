# Mental Models Cheat Sheet
**5 Ways to Think About AI That Save You Hours**

---

## 1. AI as "Smart Intern"
**What It Means:** AI has read everything but needs clear instructions and supervision.

**In Practice:**
- AI does first draft → You do final review
- Never publish AI content without verification
- Treat outputs as starting points, not finished products

**Remember:** You wouldn't send an intern to a client meeting alone. Same rule applies here.

---

## 2. Trust But Verify
**What It Means:** AI will confidently state things that are wrong (hallucinations).

**In Practice:**
- ✓ Verify every fact, number, address, claim
- ✓ Check square footage, beds/baths, school zones
- ✓ Confirm any "close to" or "near" statements

**Warning Signs:**
- AI says "top-rated schools nearby" → Check GreatSchools.org
- AI mentions features not in your data → Fabrication
- Statistics without sources → Always verify

**Remember:** If AI says it, verify it.

## 3. Context Over Cleverness
**What It Means:** AI quality depends on details you provide, not prompt tricks.

**Compare These:**

**❌ BAD (Generic):**
"Write a listing description"
→ Result: Boring, cookie-cutter output

**✓ GOOD (Specific):**
"Write 150-word listing for 123 Main St, 3bd/2ba ranch, updated kitchen (2022), Williamson schools, targeting first-time buyers, friendly tone, no superlatives"
→ Result: Specific, on-brand, usable

**The Rule:** More specifics = Better output. Generic prompts = Generic results.

**Remember:** Feed it details, get back quality.

## 4. OODA Loop (Iterate Fast)
**What It Means:** Observe output → Orient (is this right?) → Decide changes → Act (iterate)

**The Process:**
1. **First try:** Generate initial output (90% of the time it needs work)
2. **Review:** What's good? What's missing? What's wrong?
3. **Iterate:** "Make it friendlier" / "Add local detail" / "Tighten to 120 words"
4. **Final check:** Verify facts, confirm voice, check compliance

**Example:**
- v1: AI writes listing (too formal, too long)
- v2: "Make it friendlier, 150 words max"
- v3: "Add mention of cul-de-sac location"
- DONE: 3 iterations, 2 minutes total

**Remember:** Ship small, iterate fast. Perfection is 2-3 rounds away, not first try.

---

## 5. Scaling Your Best People
**What It Means:** AI captures and scales what your top performers do.

**In Practice:**
- Your best agent's listing voice → Taught to AI → Used by whole team
- Your proven email sequences → Templated with AI → Consistent quality
- Your objection responses → Documented → Scalable across team

**The Vision:** Amplify excellence across your organization.

**Remember:** AI multiplies best practices, it doesn't replace humans.

## When AI Doesn't Work, Ask:

□ **Did I give enough context?** (Model #3)
□ **Did I verify the facts?** (Model #2)
