## How to Score AI Fit (1-5)

**5 = Perfect fit**
- Highly repetitive
- Clear inputs → clear outputs
- You have the data/context to provide
- Low risk if AI makes a mistake (you'll catch it)
- Example: Property descriptions, email responses

**4 = Strong fit**
- Repetitive with some variation
- Mostly clear inputs/outputs
- Medium risk
- Example: Market summaries, CMA data extraction

**3 = Moderate fit**
- Some repetition
- Requires judgment but AI can help
- Need to verify carefully
- Example: Client objection responses

**2 = Weak fit**
- Requires significant judgment
- High risk
- AI can assist but not automate
- Example: Pricing strategy decisions

**1 = Not a fit**
- Requires human touch, relationships, licensing
- Cannot be delegated to AI
- Example: In-person showings, negotiations

---

## Calculate Impact Score

**Formula**: Impact Score = (Min/Week) × (AI Fit Score)

**Example**:
- Task: Write property descriptions
- Time: 60 min/week
- AI Fit: 5
- Impact Score: 60 × 5 = **300**

**Higher score = Higher priority for automation**

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: "I can't think of any jobs"**
→ Track your time for 2 days. Write down everything you do in 15-min blocks.

**Problem: "Everything requires human judgment"**
→ AI doesn't replace judgment - it handles the first draft. You still review and decide.

**Problem: "Scores are all the same"**
→ Compare: Which job do you HATE doing? Which takes the MOST time? Start there.

**Problem: "I picked 2 pilots but don't know how to start"**
→ Refer to Module 5 (Prompting) and Module 6 (Context Engineering) handouts.
