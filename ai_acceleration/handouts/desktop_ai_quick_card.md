## The 3 Core Workflows

---

## Workflow 1: PDF Extraction & Summary

### **Use Case:** Extract key data from market reports, CMAs, inspection reports, HOA docs

### **Steps:**

**1. Drop PDF into chat**
- Drag file from desktop OR click attachment icon
- Wait for file to upload (5-10 seconds)

**2. Give extraction command**
```
Extract the following from this PDF:
- Median sale price (this month vs. last month)
- Days on market (DOM) trend
- Inventory levels (number of active listings)
- List-to-sale ratio
- Any major insights mentioned

Format as a table.
```

**3. Verify & use**
- Spot-check numbers against PDF visually
- Copy table into email/presentation
- Ask follow-ups: "What does this mean for sellers?"

### **Time Savings:** 15 min manual reading → 2 min AI extraction

---

### **Example Prompts for PDFs:**

**Inspection Report:**
```
List all items flagged as "Major Concern" or "Safety Issue" from this inspection report. For each, include page number and estimated repair cost if mentioned.
```

**HOA Documents:**
```
Summarize the key rules in this HOA covenant that would affect:
1. Renting the property
2. Exterior modifications
3. Pet ownership
4. Parking
```

**Title Commitment:**
```
Extract all exceptions and easements from Schedule B. List them in plain language a buyer would understand.
```

**Market Report:**
```
Create a 100-word summary for sellers highlighting:
- Current market conditions (buyer vs seller market)
- Price trends
- Time to sell expectations
Use neutral, data-driven language.
```

---

## Workflow 2: Photo & Screenshot Analysis

### **Use Case:** Extract details from listing photos, analyze comps, process email screenshots

### **Steps:**

**1. Capture screenshot or drop photo**
- Mac: `Cmd+Shift+4` (select area)
- Windows: `Windows+Shift+S` (Snipping Tool)
- OR drop photo from phone/camera

**2. Give analysis command**
```
Analyze this listing photo. List:
1. All visible features (kitchen appliances, flooring, fixtures)
2. Condition indicators (updated vs. dated)
3. Style/aesthetic (modern, traditional, etc.)
4. Potential listing description highlights

Do not invent details - only describe what's clearly visible.
```

**3. Verify & use**
- Cross-check against your in-person visit
- Use for listing descriptions
- Share with clients for feature confirmation

### **Time Savings:** 10 min manual note-taking → 1 min AI analysis

---

### **Example Prompts for Images:**

**Listing Photos:**
```
From these 5 listing photos, create a feature list for MLS:
- Kitchen updates
- Flooring types
- Bathroom fixtures
- Notable architectural details
Be specific but only list what's clearly visible.
```

**Email Thread Screenshot:**
```
This is a long email chain. Extract:
1. What the client is asking for
2. What I committed to
3. What the next action item is
4. Deadline mentioned (if any)
```

**Comp Photos (for CMA):**
```
Compare these 3 property photos side-by-side. For each, note:
- Update level (1-10, where 10 is fully renovated)
- Visible upgrades
- Style differences
Help me justify pricing variance in my CMA.
```

**Hand-written Notes:**
```
[Upload photo of handwritten notes from showing]
Transcribe these notes and organize into:
- Client must-haves
- Nice-to-haves
- Deal breakers
- Budget discussed
```

## Workflow 3: Email & Message Thread Processing

### **Use Case:** Condense long email threads, extract action items, draft replies

### **Steps:**

**1. Screenshot or copy email thread**
- Screenshot entire thread OR copy-paste text
- Include all context (subject line, sender, dates)

**2. Give processing command**
```
Read this email thread and:
1. Summarize the key issue in 2 sentences
2. List all action items for me
3. Identify any deadlines
4. Note any questions I need to answer
5. Suggest a concise reply that addresses all points
```

**3. Review & send**
- Verify AI caught all nuances
- Edit reply for your voice
- Handle action items

### **Time Savings:** 20 min reading long thread → 3 min AI summary + review

---

### **Example Prompts for Email/Messages:**

**Client Inquiry:**
```
This client is asking about [property]. Extract:
- Budget
- Timeline to purchase
- Must-have features
- Current housing situation (renting, selling, etc.)
- Financing status

Then draft a 100-word reply that:
- Confirms I received their inquiry
- Asks 2-3 clarifying questions
- Proposes next steps
```

**Multi-Party Thread:**
```
This is an email thread with lender, title, and buyer's agent. Create a bullet-point summary of:
- Current status
- Who is waiting on whom
- What I need to do next
- Any timeline risks
```

**Client Objections:**
```
This client email raises concerns about [property]. Identify:
1. Their specific objections
2. Underlying fears/motivations
3. Suggested talking points to address each concern

Then draft a reply that's empathetic, addresses concerns with facts, and keeps conversation moving forward.
```

## Verification Checklist

**Before using AI output, ALWAYS verify:**

□ **Numbers**: AI can misread digits (verify all prices, sqft, dates)
□ **Names**: AI can misspell or mix up names
□ **Compliance**: AI doesn't know Fair Housing rules - YOU must check
□ **Context**: AI might miss sarcasm, urgency, or emotional tone
□ **Completeness**: AI might miss pages or details

**Golden Rule**: AI does first draft, YOU do final review

## Privacy & Data Handling

### **NEVER Upload to AI:**
- ❌ Client SSNs or financial account numbers
- ❌ Signed contracts with confidential terms
- ❌ Attorney work product or privileged communications
- ❌ Non-public MLS data (check MLS rules)
- ❌ Anything you wouldn't put in an unsecured email

### **Safe to Upload:**
- ✅ Public listing information
- ✅ Published market reports
- ✅ Your own marketing materials
- ✅ Screenshots of public websites
- ✅ Photos you own (with identifiable info removed)

### **When in Doubt:**
- Anonymize addresses: "Property A" instead of "123 Main St"
- Redact client names: "The seller" instead of "John Smith"
- Remove identifying details before upload

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Problem: File won't upload**
**Solution:**
- Check file size (most tools: 10-20MB limit)
- Try different format (convert to PDF or PNG)
- Compress large files first

### **Problem: AI misreads PDF**
**Solution:**
- Ensure PDF has selectable text (not scanned image)
- Try different PDF viewer (Adobe vs. Preview)
- Ask AI: "Can you read this file clearly?"

### **Problem: AI gives incomplete answer**
**Solution:**
- Ask follow-up: "What about [missing detail]?"
- Break into smaller questions
- Upload file again if it timed out

### **Problem: AI invents details**
**Solution:**
- Add to prompt: "Only use details explicitly stated in the file"
- Add: "If information is not in the file, say 'not found'"
- Always verify against original file

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Productivity Boost)

### **Mac:**
- Screenshot area: `Cmd+Shift+4`
- Screenshot window: `Cmd+Shift+4+Space`
- Copy: `Cmd+C`
- Paste: `Cmd+V`
