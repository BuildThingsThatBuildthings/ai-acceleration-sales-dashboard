## The 4 Attack Vectors

### 1. 🎯 TEXT FRAUD (Phishing & Impersonation)
### 2. 🎤 VOICE FRAUD (Cloning & Deepfakes)
### 3. 📸 IMAGE FRAUD (Fake Listings & Manipulation)
### 4. 📄 DOCUMENT FRAUD (Altered Contracts & Deeds)

---

## 1. TEXT FRAUD: Email & Messaging Scams

### **RED FLAGS**

#### **Email Domain Tricks**
□ **Look-alike domains**: `tit1ecompany.com` (number 1 instead of L)
□ **Extra characters**: `title-company-llc.com` (unexpected hyphens)
□ **Wrong domain**: `titlecompanytx@gmail.com` (legitimate name, free email)
□ **Misspellings**: `titllecompany.com` (double L)

**How to check:** Hover over sender email (don't click) and read FULL address

---

#### **Language Patterns**
□ **Urgency**: "Wire today or closing will be delayed"
□ **Last-minute changes**: Wire instructions change with <48 hours to closing
□ **Unexpected requests**: "Verify" or "update" banking details out of nowhere
□ **Pressure tactics**: "Don't call us, just wire immediately"
□ **Grammatical perfection**: AI writes flawless emails (sometimes TOO perfect)

---

#### **Content Red Flags**
□ **Wire instructions via email alone** (NEVER acceptable)
□ **Request to bypass normal process** ("Use this new secure portal")
□ **Personal information requests** (SSN, account passwords)
□ **Links to "update" or "confirm" information**
□ **Attachments asking you to enable macros**

---

### **VERIFICATION PROTOCOL: Text Communications**

**STEP 1:** ❌ **Never act on email alone**

**STEP 2:** ✅ **Call using a known number**
- Use number from business card, title commitment, or your records
- DO NOT use phone number provided in email
- DO NOT reply to the email

**STEP 3:** ✅ **Verbally confirm ALL details**
- Complete account number (read back digit-by-digit)
- Routing number
- Bank name
- Recipient name (exact spelling)
- Wire amount

**STEP 4:** ✅ **Establish code word** with title officer/attorney

**STEP 5:** ✅ **If ANY changes occur** → Repeat entire protocol

**STEP 6:** ✅ **Document verification** (who you called, when, what was confirmed)

---

## 2. VOICE FRAUD: Cloning & Audio Deepfakes

### **RED FLAGS**

#### **Call Quality Indicators**
□ **Slightly robotic** or flat intonation
□ **Unusual pauses** or timing
□ **Background noise cuts out** unnaturally
□ **Audio quality changes** mid-conversation
□ **Caller ID spoofing** (shows legitimate number but sounds off)

---

#### **Behavioral Red Flags**
□ **Urgent financial requests** ("Wire money now")
□ **Emotional manipulation** ("I'm in trouble, need cash")
□ **Refuses video call** or in-person meeting
□ **Avoids personal details** only you and real person would know
□ **Pressure to act immediately** without verification

---

### **VERIFICATION PROTOCOL: Voice Communications**

**STEP 1:** ✅ **Establish pre-arranged code word** with frequent contacts
- Family members
- Title officers
- Attorneys
- Lenders
- Clients in active transactions

**STEP 2:** ✅ **Ask verification questions** only real person would know
- "What was the first property I showed you?"
- "What's your dog's name?"
- "What restaurant did we meet at last month?"

**STEP 3:** ✅ **Hang up and call back** using known number
- DO NOT use call-back number provided by caller
- Look up number independently

**STEP 4:** ✅ **Request video call** if possible
- Deepfake video exists but is harder to fake in real-time
- Ask them to do specific actions (wave, hold up object)

**STEP 5:** ✅ **Trust your gut**
- If something feels "off," it probably is
- Better to over-verify than lose money

---

## 3. IMAGE FRAUD: Fake Listings & Manipulated Photos

### **RED FLAGS**

#### **Listing Photo Manipulation**
□ **Too perfect**: Unrealistic sky, grass, or lighting
□ **Clone stamping**: Repeated patterns (trees, clouds, furniture)
□ **Perspective issues**: Windows/doors don't align with structure
□ **Color inconsistencies**: Shadows don't match lighting direction
□ **Object removal artifacts**: Blurry areas where items were removed
□ **Added features**: Furniture, landscaping that doesn't exist

---

#### **Property Fraud Indicators**
□ **Address manipulation**: Street number digitally altered
□ **Fake staging**: Furniture too perfect or clearly digital
□ **Seasonal mismatches**: Summer greenery but listing date is winter
□ **Watermark removal**: Professional photos without photographer watermark
□ **Stock photos**: Reverse image search finds same photo elsewhere

---

### **VERIFICATION PROTOCOL: Images**

**STEP 1:** ✅ **Reverse image search**
- Google Images: Upload photo or paste URL
- TinEye.com: Specialized reverse search
- Check if photo appears on multiple listings

**STEP 2:** ✅ **Cross-reference with MLS**
- Verify photos match MLS listing
- Check upload dates match listing timeline

**STEP 3:** ✅ **Request original, unedited photos** from seller/photographer
- Compare to published versions
- Check metadata (EXIF data) for editing software

**STEP 4:** ✅ **Schedule in-person showing**
- Verify property matches photos
- Take your own photos for comparison

**STEP 5:** ✅ **Disclose enhancements**
- Virtual staging MUST be labeled
- Repairs/renovations must be disclosed if shown but not completed
- Follow MLS rules for photo editing

---

## 4. DOCUMENT FRAUD: Altered Contracts & Forgeries

### **RED FLAGS**

#### **Visual Indicators**
□ **Font inconsistencies**: Different fonts or sizes within same document
□ **Alignment issues**: Text doesn't align with form fields
□ **White-out artifacts**: Covered text visible on close inspection
□ **Signature variations**: Signature looks different than previous docs
□ **Date inconsistencies**: Date format changes within document
□ **Copy-paste errors**: Duplicate phrases or formatting glitches

---

#### **Content Red Flags**
□ **Unexpected changes**: Terms differ from verbal agreement
□ **Missing pages**: Page numbers skip
□ **Wrong party names**: Misspellings or name variations
□ **Unusual requests**: "Don't share with attorney/agent"
□ **Last-minute substitutions**: New document appears right before closing

---

### **VERIFICATION PROTOCOL: Documents**

**STEP 1:** ✅ **Request original via known channel**
- Use title company's secure portal (not emailed link)
- Pick up in person when possible
- Verify sender before opening attachments

**STEP 2:** ✅ **Compare to previous versions**
- Use PDF comparison tools (Adobe Acrobat Compare)
- Check version history if using DocuSign/digital signature platform
- Verify all parties received same version

**STEP 3:** ✅ **Verify signatures**
- Compare to signature on file
- For high-value transactions, notarize in person
- Use digital signature audit trail (DocuSign, etc.)

**STEP 4:** ✅ **Check document metadata**
- Right-click PDF → Properties → Check creation date and author
- Verify it matches expected source

**STEP 5:** ✅ **Attorney/title company review**
- All contracts reviewed by licensed professional
- Never waive attorney review to "speed up" closing

---

## Universal Verification Rule

### **THE GOLDEN RULE: Verify Via Known Channel**

**KNOWN CHANNEL means:**
- ✅ Phone number from business card you received in person
- ✅ Phone number from title commitment document
- ✅ Email address from prior verified conversation thread
- ✅ Secure portal you set up directly with company
- ✅ In-person verification at known office location

**KNOWN CHANNEL does NOT mean:**
- ❌ Phone number included in suspicious email
- ❌ Email address from forwarded message
- ❌ Link provided in text message
- ❌ Contact info from Google search (can be spoofed)
- ❌ Callback number from voicemail

---

## Your 30-Second Fraud Check

**Before you wire money, sign a document, or share sensitive info:**

□ Did I receive this request via a verified, known channel?
□ Does anything feel "off" or unusual?
□ Am I being pressured to act immediately?
□ Have I verified this request independently (call back using known number)?
□ Would I bet $72,000 that this is legitimate? (Because you might be)

**If you answered "no" to any question → STOP and verify**

---

## Report Fraud Immediately

**If you suspect fraud:**

1. **Stop**: Do not proceed with wire transfer or transaction
2. **Verify**: Call known contact to confirm legitimacy
3. **Report**:
   - FBI IC3: www.ic3.gov
   - FTC: reportfraud.ftc.gov
   - Local police
   - Your title company
   - Your brokerage compliance officer

**Time matters**: Many banks can reverse wires if caught within hours

---

## Office Fraud Prevention SOP

**Create office-wide protocol:**

□ **No wires via email alone** (company policy)
□ **Code words established** with all frequent contacts
□ **Dual verification** required for all wire transfers >$10,000
□ **Mandatory waiting period** (24 hours) for any last-minute wire changes
□ **Monthly fraud training** for all agents and staff
□ **Incident reporting process** clearly defined

---
