# Prompting Framework Card
**Essential Elements for Better AI Outputs**

---

## Prompting Fundamentals

Every effective prompt has these 5 elements. Use them all for best results.

---

### **Element 1: CONTEXT**
**What to include:** Role, audience, channel, purpose

**Template:**
"You are [role]. Write for [audience] who will see this on [channel]"

**Real Estate Examples:**
- "You are my real estate copywriter. Write for first-time homebuyers who will read this on Zillow"
- "You are my client communication assistant. Write for sellers who will receive this via email"
- "You are my social media manager. Write for my sphere of influence on Instagram"

---

### **Element 2: LENGTH & FORMAT**
**What to include:** Word count, structure, formatting preferences

**Template:**
"[X] words, [structure], [formatting notes]"

**Real Estate Examples:**
- "120-150 words, 2 short paragraphs, end with clear call-to-action"
- "3 bullet points, each under 15 words, conversational tone"
- "Email format: greeting, 2-3 sentences, question, closing"

**Why it matters:** Prevents rambling or too-short outputs

---

### **Element 3: ESSENTIAL FACTS**
**What to include:** Non-negotiable details AI must use

**Template:**
"Facts: [list all specific, verifiable details]"

**Real Estate Example:**
"Facts: 456 Oak Street, Williamson County. 3 bed, 2 bath, 1,650 sqft ranch. Renovated kitchen (2022): quartz counters, stainless appliances. Hardwood floors in living areas. Fenced backyard, two-car garage. Walnut Grove Elementary school zone (8/10 rating). Cul-de-sac location. 10 min drive to downtown Franklin."

**CRITICAL:** This is where you prevent hallucinations. Give AI the facts.

---

### **Element 4: APPROACH / TONE**
**What to include:** Voice, style, emotional register

**Template:**
"Tone: [adjectives], [what to emphasize]"

**Real Estate Examples:**
- "Tone: friendly but professional, approachable not salesy, emphasize family-friendly features"
- "Tone: data-driven and transparent, warm but not overly emotional"
- "Tone: luxury-focused, sophisticated, emphasize exclusivity and quality"

**Why it matters:** Determines how relatable and on-brand the output is

---

### **Element 5: RESTRICTIONS & EXCLUSIONS**
**What to include:** What NOT to say or do

**Template:**
"Do not: [list prohibitions]"

**Real Estate Examples:**
- "Do not use superlatives like 'stunning,' 'gorgeous,' 'dream home'"
- "Avoid any language that could violate Fair Housing (no 'perfect for families,' 'great church nearby,' demographic descriptors)"
- "Do not mention price - that's in the MLS field"
- "Do not use exclamation points or all caps"

**Why it matters:** Compliance, brand protection, avoiding clichés

## The Iteration Loop

### **After First Output:**

**If too long:** "Tighten to [X] words max"

**If too formal:** "Make this friendlier and more conversational"

**If missing something:** "Add a mention of [specific detail]"

**If wrong tone:** "Rewrite with [different tone]"

**If weak ending:** "Write a stronger call-to-action in the last sentence"

### **The Pattern:**
1. First try with CLEAR prompt (80% of the way there)
2. One iteration (95% of the way there)
3. Final tweak (100% ready)

**Total time:** 2-3 minutes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too vague:** "Write a listing"
✓ **Specific:** Use all 5 CLEAR elements

❌ **No facts:** AI invents details
✓ **Provide facts:** AI uses your accurate data

❌ **No restrictions:** AI uses clichés, risky language
✓ **List exclusions:** AI avoids problems

❌ **Expecting perfection on v1**
✓ **Iterate 2-3 times:** Fast improvements

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Before you hit "send" on your prompt, check:**

□ Did I set context (role, audience, channel)?
□ Did I specify length and format?
□ Did I provide all essential facts?
□ Did I describe the tone/approach?
□ Did I list restrictions and exclusions?

**If yes to 4-5: You'll get a good output**
**If yes to 2-3: You'll probably need more iteration**
**If yes to 0-1: Start over with the 5 elements**
