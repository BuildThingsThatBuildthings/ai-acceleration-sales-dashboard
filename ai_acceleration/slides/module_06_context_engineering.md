# Module 6: Context Engineering

---

## Same Prompt. Different Results.

**WITHOUT Context Card:**
> "Write an email responding to a buyer who says rates are too high"

Generic, forgettable response

**WITH Context Card:**
> "Write an email responding to a buyer who says rates are too high"

Your voice + Your data + Your local expertise + Your objection handling

**That's context engineering.**

---

## What is Context Engineering?

**Definition:** Feeding AI your specific details once, then reusing across all tasks

**Analogy:** Like briefing a new assistant on how you work - do it once, benefit forever

**The Formula:**
```
Generic AI + Context Card = AI that sounds like YOU
```

**Context = Voice + Tactics + Local Knowledge + Constraints**

## The Voice & Tactics Card

**4 Sections That Transform AI Outputs:**

1. **Voice Pillars** - Your brand personality (3-5 words)
2. **Taboo Phrases** - What you NEVER say + style rules
3. **Objection Responses** - Top 5-10 buyer/seller objections with YOUR rebuttals
4. **Local Nuance** - Hyperlocal knowledge AI can't know

**1 page. 200-300 words. Reusable forever.**

## Section 1: Voice Pillars

**What to capture:** 3-5 words/phrases that define your brand voice

**Real Estate Examples:**
- "Knowledgeable but never condescending"
- "Data-driven and transparent"
- "Warm, relationship-focused, community-oriented"

**Template field:** "My brand voice is: [adjectives]"

**Your turn (think):** What 3 words define YOUR voice?

---

## Section 2: Taboo Phrases & Style Rules

**What to capture:** Phrases you never use + words to avoid + style preferences

**Real Estate Examples:**
- Never: "luxurious," "stunning," "motivated seller," "dream home"
- Always: Data over adjectives, specific over vague
- Avoid: Exclamation points, all caps, emoji (unless social media)

**Template field:** "Never say: [list]. Always: [preferences]"

**Why it matters:** Compliance, brand protection, avoiding clichés

---

## Section 3: Objection Responses

**What to capture:** Top 5-10 buyer/seller objections with YOUR standard rebuttals

**Real Estate Examples:**

**Objection:** "The market is too high to buy now"
**Your Response:** "I show data on rent vs. buy costs + equity building. Rates matter less than long-term value"

**Objection:** "Why list with you vs. discount broker?"
**Your Response:** "Professional photos, staging, aggressive marketing, negotiation expertise. Data shows I sell 8% higher on average"

**Critical note:** AI can't make these up - you have to give them

---

## Section 4: Local Nuance & Micro-Geography

**What to capture:** Hyperlocal knowledge AI can't possibly know

**Williamson County Examples:**
- Schools: Top-rated (9/10 average), major buyer draw
- Franklin: 15 min to downtown, dining/culture hub
- Brentwood: Upscale, family-oriented, HOAs common
- Spring Hill: New construction, commuter-friendly, growing fast

**Template field:** "Local details: [neighborhoods, schools, amenities, quirks]"

**This is your competitive advantage.**
