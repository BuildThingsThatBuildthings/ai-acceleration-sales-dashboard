# Module 11: Capstone Sprint

**Build Your Production-Ready AI System**

Time: 3:25 PM - 3:55 PM (30 minutes)

---

## The Challenge

You've learned:
- Mental models for AI
- Prompting fundamentals
- Context engineering
- Tool selection
- Security awareness
- Desktop AI workflows

**Now: Put it all together**

---

## Your Mission

Build ONE complete AI micro-system for a real job in your business

**By 4 PM**: Walk out with a system you can use Monday morning

Not theory. Not notes. A **working system**.

---

## What Is a Micro-System?

A complete 5-component package for one AI-powered job:

1. **Prompt file** - CLEAR prompt for the job
2. **Context card** - Your voice, tactics, local knowledge
3. **Sample inputs** - 2 examples of raw material
4. **Verified outputs** - 2 AI outputs you've reviewed
5. **Measurement plan** - Track time saved and quality

**Systems are repeatable. One-off attempts are not.**

---

## The Build Process

**Step 1 (5 min)**: Choose your pilot job
- Use one from Module 8 job scan
- Pick the highest-impact opportunity

**Step 2 (8 min)**: Build the system
- Write/refine prompt using CLEAR framework
- Attach context card from Module 6
- Generate 2 test outputs with real inputs
- Verify accuracy and quality

---

## The Build Process (cont.)

**Step 3 (3 min)**: Package for reuse
- Save prompt + context in template file
- Document process clearly
- "For [Job], use this prompt, expect [X] min, verify [these facts]"

**Step 4 (2 min)**: Define measurement
- Time before AI: [X] minutes
- Time with AI: [X] minutes
- Quality check: [How you'll verify it's good]

---

## Success Rubric (10 Points)

| Criterion | Points | What It Means |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Clarity** | 2 pts | Prompt is specific, includes CLEAR elements |
| **Context** | 2 pts | Context card used, voice/tactics integrated |
| **Safety/Compliance** | 2 pts | Verification steps, no Fair Housing risks |
| **Measurable Outcome** | 2 pts | Clear time savings or quality metric |
| **Repeatability** | 2 pts | System can be reused without re-learning |

**Target: 7+ points = Ready for Monday**

## Quick Demo: Listing Description System

**Job**: Listing descriptions - 30 min → 10 min target

1. Open template, paste CLEAR prompt
2. Add context card (voice pillars, taboos)
3. Input: 3bd/2ba, 1850 sqft, 456 Oak St + details
4. Generate → Review → Approve
5. Save as "Listing_Description_System.doc"
6. Document: "Use with MLS data. 10 min. Verify: sqft, beds/baths, school"

---

## Your Turn: Build Time

**18 minutes of focused work**

Use your Capstone Pack Template

**Support available**: Raise hand for help anytime

**Remember**: Done is better than perfect. Ship small.

---

## What You're Creating

**Prompt File Example**:
```
You are my real estate copywriting assistant.

TASK: Write a [TYPE] for [PROPERTY] targeting [AUDIENCE].

CONTEXT: [Your Voice & Tactics Card]

FACTS: [Property specs / data points]

STYLE: [Tone/length/format]

EXCLUDE: [Do-not-say items, Fair Housing risks]

VERIFICATION: List the 3 facts you used for my review.
```

---

## Measurement Plan Template

**Before AI Implementation**:
- Task: [Specific job]
- Current time: [X] minutes per occurrence
- Frequency: [X] times per week
- Total weekly time: [X] hours

**After AI Implementation**:
- Target time: [X] minutes per occurrence
- Weekly time saved: [X] hours
- Quality check method: [How you'll verify]
- Review schedule: [When you'll assess if it's working]

---

## The Outcome

By end of this sprint, you have:
- 1 production-ready AI system
- Template you can reuse immediately
- Clear measurement approach
- Confidence to build more systems

**This is your foundation. Build on it Monday.**

---

## Let's Build

**Timer starts now: 18 minutes**

Choose your pilot job. Build your system. Package it for Monday.

You've got this.
