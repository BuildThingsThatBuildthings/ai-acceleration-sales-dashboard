# Module 5
## Prompting Fundamentals

**AI Acceleration Workshop**
Williamson County Association of REALTORS

---

## The Difference Between Success and Frustration

**Bad Prompt:**
> "Write a listing description"

**Good Prompt:**
> "Write a 150-word listing description for 789 Maple Ave, 4bd/3ba two-story, targeting move-up buyers, professional tone, lead with the gourmet kitchen and main-floor master, mention Williamson schools, avoid any Fair Housing issues"

---

## The Results

**Bad Prompt Output:**
- Generic and vague
- Missing key details
- Wrong tone
- Could take 30+ min to fix

**Good Prompt Output:**
- Specific and accurate
- Includes all essentials
- Right tone and structure
- Ready to publish in 5 min

> **The difference between "AI doesn't work" and "AI saves me hours" is your prompt.**

---

## Prompting Fundamentals

Five elements that turn vague prompts into precise instructions:

- **Context**: Role, audience, channel
- **Length & Format**: Word count, structure
- **Essential Facts**: Non-negotiable details
- **Approach/Tone**: Voice and style
- **Restrictions**: What NOT to say

---

## Element 1: Context

**What it is:** Role, audience, channel, purpose

**Why it matters:** AI adapts style based on context

**Real Estate Example:**
> "You are my real estate copywriter. Write for first-time homebuyers who will see this on Zillow"

**Template:**
> "You are [role]. Write for [audience] who will see this on [channel]"

---

## Element 2: Length & Format

**What it is:** Word count, structure, formatting preferences

**Why it matters:** Prevents rambling or too-short outputs

**Real Estate Example:**
> "120-150 words, 2 short paragraphs, end with one-line call to action"

**Template:**
> "[X] words, [structure], [any formatting notes]"

---

## Element 3: Essential Facts

**What it is:** Non-negotiable details AI must include

**Why it matters:** Accuracy and relevance depend on this

**Real Estate Example:**
> "Facts: 3bd/2ba, 1,400 sqft, updated kitchen (2023), fenced yard, Walnut Grove Elementary zone, cul-de-sac, $389K"

**Critical Note:**
> This is where you prevent hallucinations - give AI the facts!

---

## Element 4: Approach/Tone

**What it is:** Voice, style, emotional register

**Why it matters:** Determines how relatable and on-brand the output is

**Real Estate Example:**
> "Tone: friendly but professional, approachable not salesy, emphasize family-friendly features"

**Template:**
> "Tone: [adjectives], [what to emphasize]"

---

## Element 5: Restrictions & Exclusions

**What it is:** What NOT to say or do

**Why it matters:** Compliance, brand protection, avoiding cliches

**Real Estate Examples:**
- "Do not use superlatives like 'stunning' or 'gorgeous'"
- "Avoid any language that could violate Fair Housing (no 'perfect for families,' 'great church nearby,' etc.)"
- "Do not mention price - that's in the MLS field"

---

## Complete Example

```
You are my real estate copywriter. Write a listing
description for first-time homebuyers who will read
this on Zillow.

Length: 140-160 words, 2 paragraphs, friendly but
professional tone.

Facts: 567 Pine Street, Williamson County. 3 bed, 2 bath,
1,650 sqft ranch. Renovated kitchen (quartz counters,
stainless appliances) in 2022. Hardwood floors in living
areas. Fenced backyard, two-car garage. Walnut Grove
Elementary school zone. Cul-de-sac location. Close to
parks and downtown Franklin (10 min drive).

Approach: Emphasize the updated kitchen and family-friendly
features (yard, schools). Make it warm and inviting,
not salesy.

Restrictions: No superlatives. No Fair Housing violations
(don't say 'perfect for families'). Don't mention price.
Lead with the kitchen.
```

## Live Demo: The Iteration Process

**Watch as we take a CLEAR prompt through 3 iterations:**

1. **Round 1:** Initial output - what works, what needs improvement
2. **Round 2:** Tighten and refine - better but not perfect
3. **Round 3:** Final polish - ready to publish

**Key Insight:**
> Did AI nail it on the first try? No. Does it need to? No.
> Iteration is normal and fast.

---

## Iteration Phrases That Work

Use these to refine outputs quickly:

- "Tighten to [X] words max"
- "Add a mention of [specific detail]"
- "Remove references to [unwanted element]"
- "Rewrite the [section] as [desired approach]"
- "Make the tone more [adjective]"
- "Lead with [element] instead"

> **Three rounds, 5 minutes total. That's the process.**

---

## Hands-On Practice (8 min)

**Your Turn: Write Your First Structured Prompt**

Choose one task:
- **Option A:** Listing description for a property you're working on
- **Option B:** Email response to common buyer/seller question
- **Option C:** Social media post about your business or listing

**Steps:**
1. Draft prompt using CLEAR framework (3 min)
2. Generate and evaluate output (3 min)
3. Quick iteration if time allows (2 min)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Structured prompting = clear prompts = better outputs**
   - Context, Length, Essential Facts, Approach, Restrictions

2. **Iteration is the process**
   - 2-3 rounds gets you from good to great
   - Don't expect perfection on first try

3. **You just saved 20-30 minutes**
   - Content that used to take half an hour now takes 5 minutes
   - This multiplies across every task you automate

---

## What's Next?

**You can now write solid prompts.**

But there's a secret weapon that takes outputs from good to **great**:

### Context Engineering
*Module 6 - Coming up next*

You'll build a reusable "Voice & Tactics" card that makes every prompt better automatically.
