# Module 7
## Identify Top Jobs (Scan)

**1:00-1:35 PM (35 minutes)**

AI Acceleration Workshop

---

## The Hidden Opportunity

> "Most people think AI = marketing and social media. Wrong."

**The biggest wins are in the invisible work**
The stuff that eats 2 hours of your day

---

## Where Your Time Really Goes

**Agent Time Breakdown:**

- 🤝 Showings/meetings: **25%**
- 📋 Admin/coordination: **25%**
- 📞 Lead follow-up: **20%**
- 📄 Transactions: **15%**
- 📱 Marketing: **15%**

**60% of your time is NOT face-to-face**

That's where AI lives.

## The Job Scan Framework

### 9 Domains to Scan (Beyond Marketing)

<div style="font-size: 0.85em;">

1. **Lead intake & triage** - First responses, qualification, CRM entry
2. **Appointment setting** - Scheduling, reminders, confirmation
3. **CRM hygiene** - Data entry, updates, tagging, notes
4. **Transaction micro-tasks** - Checklist tracking, doc requests, status updates
5. **Listing prep** - Copy, descriptions, social posts, email blasts
6. **Market intelligence** - Report summaries, comp research, trend briefs
7. **Customer service language** - FAQs, objection responses, follow-up
8. **Knowledge surfacing** - "What's our policy on X?", internal docs search
9. **Ops coordination** - Vendor scheduling, inspection follow-up, closing

</div>

**Key insight:** Think jobs, not roles. Break it down to 10-15 minute tasks.

## Selection Criteria for Pilots

### Pick Winners with These 5 Criteria:

<div style="font-size: 0.85em;">

**1. Minutes Per Week**
- How much time does this consume weekly?
- Target: **30+ minutes/week minimum** for pilot
- Example: Listing descriptions (2 hrs/week) ✓ | Negotiation strategy (10 min/week) ✗

**2. Repeatability**
- Is this the same task over and over?
- Target: **70%+ similar** across instances
- Example: Lead triage emails (90% repeatable) ✓ | Crisis management (10% repeatable) ✗

**3. Risk Level**
- What happens if AI output is wrong?
- Target: **Low to medium risk** for pilots
- Example: Social media caption (low risk) ✓ | Contract terms (high risk) ✗

</div>

---

## Selection Criteria (Continued)

<div style="font-size: 0.85em;">

**4. Measurability**
- Can you measure time saved or quality improved?
- Target: **Clear before/after metrics**
- Example: Listing description time (30 min → 5 min) ✓ | "Better relationships" (vague) ✗

**5. Data Availability**
- Do you have the inputs AI needs?
- Target: **Facts already exist** in MLS, CRM, or your head
- Example: Listing description (MLS data + photos) ✓ | Market trends (requires research) ✗

</div>

## The 2-Pilot Rule

**Pick 2 jobs to pilot in next 30 days**

One content job (listing, email)
+
One workflow job (triage, CRM)

**Why only 2?**
Focus beats breadth. Measure what works.
