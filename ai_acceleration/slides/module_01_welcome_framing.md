## Real AI Skills for Real Estate Pros

**Ryan, Build Things that Build Things**
Williamson County Association of REALTORS

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Keep intro brief (30 seconds max)
- "I'm Ryan, I've spent years helping professionals use AI without the hype"
- PROVOCATIVE OPENER: "Here's what won't happen today: death by PowerPoint, jargon overload, or tools you'll never use. Here's what WILL happen: you'll create real AI outputs for your business in the first hour, and leave with systems you'll use Monday morning"
- SHOW OF HANDS: "Who's tried ChatGPT? Who uses it weekly? Who's skeptical this will work?"
- Goal: Set energy, establish credibility, calibrate the room

# House Rules

**70% Hands-On** | 30% Instruction

1. **Laptops recommended** (but optional)
2. **No stupid questions** (if you're confused, 3 others are too)
3. **Safe to struggle** (iteration is normal)
4. **Phones on silent** (you'll need to focus)
5. **Bring real content** (your listings, your emails)

**Schedule:** 9am-4pm | Breaks built in | Lunch 12-1:10pm

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Don't let tech anxiety stop participation - web-based only, no installs
- Psychological safety is critical - this is a learning space
- AI is new for most people - struggling is part of the process
- We need focus for hands-on work
- Best learning happens with your actual real estate content
- Q&A: "Any questions about schedule or logistics? Technology concerns?"
- TRANSITION: "Let's start by hearing from YOU - what do you need AI to solve? That's Module 2"
- Timing: Can compress to 8 min or extend to 12 min based on room energy
- Watch for anxiety on faces when saying "hands-on" - reassure immediately
