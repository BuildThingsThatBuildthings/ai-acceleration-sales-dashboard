## You Did It

**Look at what you accomplished today:**

- Learned AI fundamentals (mental models, capabilities, limitations)
- Built effective prompts with CLEAR framework
- Created your personal Voice & Tactics card
- Scanned your workflows and selected pilot jobs
- Evaluated and chose AI tools strategically
- Mastered fraud detection and security protocols
- Built a complete, production-ready AI system

**You're now in the top 10% of real estate professionals on AI capability**

The question is: **Will you use it?**

## Your Commitment

### This Week (Next 7 Days)

**Public Commitment:**

> "In the next 7 days, I will use my AI system for [YOUR PILOT JOB] at least 3 times"

**Write it down. Say it out loud. Take a photo.**

**Accountability increases follow-through by 65%**

### The 30-Day Challenge

- **Week 1:** Use your system 3 times (build the habit)
- **Week 2:** Use it 5+ times (prove the time savings)
- **Week 3:** Refine your prompts based on results
- **Week 4:** Add your second pilot job

**By week 3, it'll be habit. By week 4, you'll wonder how you worked without it.**
