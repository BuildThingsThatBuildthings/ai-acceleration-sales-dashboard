# Module 8
## Finding AI Tools
### (Keep Stack Tiny)

**1:35-2:00 PM (25 minutes)**

---

## The Tool Overload Trap

"I've seen agents sign up for **12 AI tools**, pay **$300/month** total, and use **none** of them."

**Why?**
- Tool overload
- Decision fatigue
- No clear job match

**The Rule:**
**2-3 tools you use daily > 10 tools you forget exist**

---

## Job-to-Tool Matching
### Start with the job, THEN find the tool

**Wrong Approach:**
"This AI tool looks cool, what can I use it for?"

**Right Approach:**
"I need to write listing descriptions faster. What tool does that best?"

**Examples:**
- Listing descriptions → ChatGPT or Claude
- Email campaign copy → ChatGPT + your context card
- Lead triage → CRM with AI (Follow Up Boss, LionDesk)
- Virtual staging → Virtual Staging AI

---

## The 5 Filters
### Avoid tool bloat with these questions

1. **Saves Minutes Now**
   Does this save time in week 1, or require months of setup?

2. **Easy to Edit**
   Can I quickly fix AI output, or is it locked?

3. **Privacy Posture**
   Where does my data go? Can client PII be exposed?

4. **Cost Clarity**
   Is pricing transparent (<$50/mo) or "contact sales"?

5. **Integrates with Workflow**
   Does this fit my current tools, or require replacing everything?

## Core Tool Stack
### Recommended minimal stack

**Tier 1 (Essential)**
- ChatGPT Plus ($20/mo) OR Claude Pro ($20/mo)
- Use for: All text tasks (listings, emails, social, summaries)

**Tier 2 (Optional - only if Tier 1 doesn't meet need)**
- Virtual staging: Virtual Staging AI ($30-50/project)
- Video: Descript or Riverside for transcription/editing
- CRM AI: Built into Follow Up Boss, LionDesk (if you already use them)

**Tier 3 (Avoid)**
- Random point solutions that duplicate general AI

---

## Key Takeaways

**Tiny stack beats big stack**
- Master 1-2 tools, don't dabble with 10

**Start with ChatGPT or Claude for 90% of tasks**
- Add specialized tools only if needed

**Filter for now-value, not future promises**
- Can you get value in the first week?

**Your 2 pilots should use 1-2 tools max**
- Default: ChatGPT Plus for most real estate tasks
