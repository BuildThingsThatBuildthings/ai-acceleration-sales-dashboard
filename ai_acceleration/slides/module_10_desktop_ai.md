## Desktop AI: Your Files Meet AI

### Desktop AI Apps
- Run on your computer (not browser)
- Examples: ChatGPT desktop, Claude desktop
- **Key Feature:** Drag-and-drop files, screenshot integration, instant access

### Connectors (MCP in Plain English)
Plugins that let AI read different file types:
- **Text:** Word, PDF, emails
- **Images:** Photos, screenshots, listing images
- **Spreadsheets:** CSV, Excel
- **Audio:** Voice notes, meeting recordings

**Why it matters:** File → AI → Output (no copy/paste)
