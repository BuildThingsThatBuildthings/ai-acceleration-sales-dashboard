## What It's Good At / What It's Not

**AI Acceleration**
9:55-10:25 (30 minutes)

## What IS AI?

> "AI is not magic, it's not intelligent, and it's not trying to take your job."

**So what is it?**

AI is a **word engine** - it predicts what words/ideas should come next based on patterns it learned.

Think: Advanced autocomplete for entire paragraphs.

---

## Word Engine, Not Truth Engine

**Key Concept:** AI generates text that **sounds plausible**, not necessarily accurate.

- No fact-checking mechanism
- Doesn't "know" anything - it pattern-matches
- Will confidently state wrong information

**Real Estate Example:**
AI can write a beautiful listing description for an address that doesn't exist.

**Catch Phrase:** _Sounds true ≠ is true_

**Always verify:** facts, dates, numbers, claims

---

## Strong Fit Use Cases

### Where AI Excels in Real Estate

1. **Drafts** - First version of listings, emails, social posts
2. **Rewrites** - "Make this friendlier/shorter/more professional"
3. **Summaries** - Condense long reports, email threads, PDFs
4. **Variations** - "Give me 5 versions of this headline"
5. **Formatting** - Turn bullets into prose, prose into bullets

**Key Insight:** AI shines when you have the facts and need the words

---

## Strong Fit Examples

- Listing description draft from MLS data
- Email response to common buyer question
- Social media post about new listing
- Open house invitation wording
- Market update summary for sphere of influence

**Time Savings:** 5-15 minutes per task

---

## Weak Fit Use Cases

### Where AI Struggles or Fails

1. **Facts it doesn't have** - Local trends, property details, client preferences
2. **Judgment calls** - Offer evaluation, negotiation strategy, client fit
3. **Relationships** - Building trust, reading emotions, personal connection
4. **Compliance/Legal** - Fair Housing interpretation, contract terms
5. **Lived experience creativity** - Hyperlocal storytelling, crisis management

**Catch Phrase:** _AI for the busywork, humans for the judgment_

---

## Weak Fit Examples

| AI Can... | But Human Decides... |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Summarize comparable sales | Pricing strategy |
| Draft objection responses | Adaptation to specific client |
| Generate email copy | Authentic relationship maintenance |
| List Fair Housing rules | Application to gray areas |

**Decision Tree:** Does AI have the facts? → Yes: Strong fit / No: Weak fit

## Live Demo: Strong Fit

### Listing Description (Good AI Use)

**Prompt with full context:**
"Write a 140-word listing description for 456 Oak Street, Williamson County. 3 bed, 2 bath, 1,850 sqft ranch. Updated kitchen (2022), hardwood floors, fenced backyard, cul-de-sac lot. Nearby: Walnut Grove Elementary (8/10 rating), 10 min to downtown Franklin. Target audience: first-time homebuyers. Tone: friendly but professional. Avoid superlatives."

**Result:** Usable in 30 seconds because we provided all the facts.

**Iteration:** "Tighten to 120 words, lead with the updated kitchen"

---

## Live Demo: Weak Fit

### Pricing Strategy (Poor AI Use)

**Prompt without context:**
"What should I price this house at?"

**Result:** Generic, useless advice

**Why?** AI doesn't know:
- Your market conditions
- Property condition beyond what you told it
- Comparable sales
- Current inventory levels

**Lesson:** AI can help with comp summaries, but YOU make the pricing call

---

## Live Demo: Medium Fit

### Email Response (AI + Human Facts)

**Prompt with context:**
"Draft a response to a buyer asking about schools near 456 Oak. Facts: Walnut Grove Elementary is 0.5 miles away, rated 8/10 on GreatSchools. Williamson County schools are highly regarded. Keep it under 100 words, professional but warm."

**Result:** Good starting point

**Human touch needed:** Personalize opening and closing

---

## Your Turn: Fit Assessment

**Quick Exercise:** Is this a strong or weak AI fit?

1. Writing a comparative market analysis narrative
2. Determining if a buyer is pre-qualified enough
3. Rewriting an email to be more concise
4. Deciding negotiation strategy for multiple offers
5. Creating 3 variations of an Instagram caption

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI = Word Engine** - Predicts plausible text, doesn't verify truth
2. **Strong Fits** - Drafts, rewrites, summaries, variations (when you provide facts)
3. **Weak Fits** - Judgment calls, relationship building, compliance decisions
4. **Always Verify** - Facts, numbers, dates, claims
5. **Best Practice** - AI for busywork, humans for judgment
