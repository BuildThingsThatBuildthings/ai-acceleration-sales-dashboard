# Module 9: AI Security & Fraud Awareness

---

## The Hard Truth

**$500 million** stolen via real estate wire fraud in 2024

**$72,000** median loss per incident

**California couple**: Lost $720,000 on a Zoom call with "their attorney"

Except it wasn't their attorney. It was a deepfake.

AI makes fraud **easier, faster, and more convincing**.

---

## 4 Attack Vectors You Must Know

1. **Wire Transfer Phishing** - Fake email "updates"
2. **Voice Cloning** - AI copies anyone's voice in 3 seconds
3. **Deepfakes & Fake Listings** - Video lies, property fraud
4. **Document Forgery** - Fake deeds, altered contracts

Each one is powered by the same AI you just learned to use.

The difference: **fraudsters got there first.**

---

## Vector 1: Wire Transfer Phishing

**The Attack:**
- Email impersonating title company with "updated" wire instructions
- AI writes perfectly convincing emails using correct names, dates, property details
- Slight domain misspelling: `tit1ecompany.com` vs `titlecompany.com`

**Real Case: West Virginia**
- Buyer received email from "title company" with wire instructions
- Everything looked legitimate: logo, signature, accurate closing details
- Wired **$255,000** to fraudster account
- Discovered fraud only when real title company asked about missing payment

---

## Wire Fraud Red Flags

**Email domain tricks:**
- `titIecompany.com` (capital I instead of lowercase L)
- `title-company-llc.com` (extra hyphens or words)
- `titlecompanytx@gmail.com` (legitimate name, wrong domain)

**Language patterns:**
- Urgency: "Wire today or closing will be delayed"
- Last-minute changes without explanation
- Request to "confirm" or "update" banking details

**Critical rule:** Wire instructions via email alone = **NEVER ACCEPTABLE**

---

## Wire Verification Protocol (Mandatory)

**Step 1:** Receive wire instructions via secure platform (not email)

**Step 2:** Call title company using number from **title commitment or business card**
- NOT the number in the email
- NOT a new number they provide

**Step 3:** Verbally confirm ALL details:
- Complete account number
- Routing number
- Bank name
- Recipient name exactly as written
- Expected wire amount

**Step 4:** Establish code word with title officer

**Step 5:** If ANY changes occur → Repeat entire protocol

---

## Vector 2: Voice Cloning

**The Technology:**
- AI clones any voice using **3-30 seconds of audio**
- Source material: YouTube videos, social media posts, listing presentations
- Quality: "Virtually indistinguishable from the original"
- Cost to fraudsters: **$10-30/month** (streaming service price)

**Real Case: NFL Rookie Dallas Turner**
- Phone call from "bank employee" about fraudulent activity
- Caller ID showed legitimate bank number (spoofed)
- AI-cloned voice sounded authentic
- Convinced to transfer **$240,000** to "secure account"
- Funds vanished immediately

---

## Voice Fraud Red Flags

**Suspicious call patterns:**
- Incoming call requesting urgent wire transfer or credential changes
- Caller resists verification: "No time to call back"
- "Emergency" requiring immediate action
- Request to provide passwords, codes, or access

**Remember:** Banks and attorneys will NEVER:
- Call requesting wire transfers
- Ask for passwords or credentials over phone
- Demand immediate action without verification

**Defense:** Hang up. Call the known number. Every single time.

---

## Voice Verification Protocol

**For ANY financial request via phone call:**

1. **Do NOT act on incoming call** - No matter how urgent it sounds
2. **Hang up** - Politely but firmly end the call
3. **Call known number** - From business card, website, or previous correspondence
4. **Verify request** - Ask if they called and if request is legitimate
5. **Use code words** - Pre-established phrases with frequent partners

**Establish code words with:**
- Your broker
- Regular title officers
- Transaction coordinators
- High-value clients

---

## Vector 3A: Deepfake Video Fraud

**The Attack:**
- Fraudster uses AI to impersonate seller/buyer on Zoom or video call
- Real-time or pre-recorded deepfake video
- Bypasses "see their face" verification

**Real Case: California - $720,000 Loss**
- Couple received Zoom meeting request from "real estate attorney"
- Attorney's face and voice appeared authentic on video
- Provided "updated" wire instructions during call
- Couple wired full closing amount
- Discovered fraud when real attorney asked about missing payment

**Real Case: Florida - Fraud Prevented**
- Title company suspicious during remote closing video
- Asked "seller" to raise hand
- Video froze, "seller" couldn't perform action
- Deepfake detected, transaction halted, fraud prevented

---

## Deepfake Detection Tactics

**During video calls:**
- Request **specific physical actions**: "Wave your hand," "Turn head left," "Hold up today's newspaper"
- Watch for **audio-video sync issues** - Slight delays or mismatches
- Check **lighting inconsistencies** - Face lighting doesn't match background
- Note **quality fluctuations** - Deepfakes may degrade when person moves

**Verification protocol:**
1. Request unpredictable actions during call
2. Out-of-band verification via phone to known number after call
3. For high-value transactions: **In-person closing strongly preferred**
4. Never authorize fund transfers based solely on video verification

---

## Vector 3B: AI-Generated Fake Listings

**The Attack:**
- Completely fabricated properties using AI-generated photos and descriptions
- Real properties misrepresented with AI-manipulated images
- Victims pay deposits, application fees, or down payments
- Property doesn't exist, isn't for sale, or doesn't match photos

**Detection challenges:**
- AI images increasingly photorealistic
- Manual detection described as "nearly impossible"
- Common tells (weird shadows, distorted text) disappearing as AI improves

**Regulatory response:**
- Australia: **$5,500-$22,000 fines** for undisclosed altered images
- NAR Code of Ethics Article 2: Prohibits misrepresentation

---

## Fake Listing Red Flags

**Photo anomalies:**
- Too-perfect symmetry (real spaces have natural imperfections)
- Unnatural or inconsistent lighting across rooms
- Repeated texture patterns (AI artifact)
- Inconsistent details: Window views change orientation, mismatched flooring
- Impossible reflections in mirrors or glass
- Warped straight lines: Door frames, baseboards appear curved
- Gibberish text on visible documents, signs, labels

**Listing behavior:**
- Price significantly below market rate
- Landlord/seller always "out of town," refuses in-person showing
- Pressure to "act fast" due to "high demand"
- Requests payment before property viewing
- Communication only via email/text, no phone calls

---

## Listing Verification Protocol

**Before showing or recommending any listing:**

1. **Reverse image search** - Google Images, TinEye (check if photos appear elsewhere)
2. **MLS verification** - For sales: Confirm listing in official MLS
3. **Property owner verification** - For rentals: Contact owner via county records
4. **In-person viewing** - ALWAYS view before client pays anything
5. **Photo disclosure** - If using AI staging: Label clearly and conspicuously

**For your own marketing:**
- Virtual staging is acceptable if **clearly disclosed**
- Label: "Virtually staged," "Digitally enhanced," "Artist rendering"
- NAR ethics require transparency about AI-enhanced images

---

## Vector 4: Document Forgery

**The Attack:**
- Forged deeds transferring property ownership
- Fake lien payoff statements
- Altered purchase agreements or addendums
- Fabricated employment/income documents for mortgage fraud

**AI enhancement:**
- Generates official-looking documents matching county formats
- Forges signatures with high accuracy
- Creates internally consistent fake financial records
- Automated notary stamp replication

**Real Case: Texas - $350,000+ Loss**
- Scheme using falsified lien payoff statements
- Falsified warranty deeds
- Falsified emails to lenders, buyers, title companies
- Multi-layered fraud affecting entire transaction

---

## Document Fraud Red Flags

**Visual inconsistencies:**
- Formatting differences from standard forms (fonts, spacing, layouts)
- Signature variations when compared to known signatures
- Quality mismatches (resolution, color, alignment)
- Metadata anomalies (creation date, author, software)

**Source concerns:**
- Documents arriving from unexpected email addresses
- "Urgent" delivery without prior discussion
- Resistance to providing originals
- Notary information that can't be verified

---

## Document Verification Protocol

**For critical documents (deeds, payoffs, amendments):**

1. **Verify notary directly**
   - Call notary using state database contact info
   - Confirm they notarized this specific document
   - Check commission expiration date

2. **Confirm county recording**
   - For recorded documents: Call county clerk
   - Verify recording number, date, parties

3. **Cross-reference known documents**
   - Compare signatures to previous documents
   - Check formatting against originals

4. **Request originals via known channel**
   - Call known number to request document
   - Do not rely on forwarded/attached versions

5. **Check metadata** (for digital documents)
   - Right-click → Properties (Windows) or Get Info (Mac)
   - Review creation date, modification history, author

---

## The Golden Rule: Verify Via Known Channel

**ANY request involving money or credentials:**

**STOP** → **VERIFY** → **PROCEED**

**Known channel means:**
- Phone number from business card (kept from in-person meeting)
- Number on title commitment document
- Number from official company website (typed directly, not clicked from email)
- Contact info from previous verified correspondence

**NEVER use:**
- Phone numbers provided in suspicious email or text
- Contact info from the message requesting action
- "Reply" to email (can be spoofed to route to fraudster)

**Remember:** 5 minutes of verification can prevent $72,000 average loss

## Client Data Protection When Using AI

**Privacy tiers for AI tools:**

**RED ZONE** - Never upload to free AI tools:
- Social Security numbers
- Banking/financial account information
- Passwords or login credentials
- Medical records
- Government-issued ID scans
- Credit reports or pre-approval letters

**YELLOW ZONE** - Enterprise AI only (with data protection):
- Client names and contact information
- Property addresses
- Transaction details
- CMA data with identifying information

**GREEN ZONE** - Safe for free AI tools:
- Generic property descriptions (no client names)
- Template content (objection handlers, email frameworks)
- Market statistics (anonymized)
- Your own marketing copy (non-confidential)

---

## AI Tool Security Checklist

**Before using any AI tool, verify:**

- **Data retention policy**: Does tool store your inputs? For how long?
- **Training usage**: Will your content train their AI model?
- **Privacy settings**: Can you opt out of data collection?
- **Enterprise options**: Is there a business tier with data protection?
- **Compliance**: Is tool GDPR/CCPA compliant?

**Best practices:**
- Use enterprise ChatGPT ($20/month) for client-related work
- Use free tier only for generic, non-confidential content
- Never paste full contracts, agreements, or financial documents
- Remove identifying information before uploading to AI
- Assume anything uploaded to free AI is potentially public
