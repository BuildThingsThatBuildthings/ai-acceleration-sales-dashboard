- [ ] Consider different AI tool
- [ ] Evaluate if job is actually AI-appropriate

**If quality drops:**
- [ ] Add more context/constraints to prompt
- [ ] Increase verification rigor
- [ ] Provide more specific examples
- [ ] Consider hybrid approach (AI draft + more human editing)

## REAL ESTATE EXAMPLES (Use Cases)

### High-Value Jobs for Capstone
1. **Listing Descriptions** - High frequency, clear inputs, easy to verify
2. **Email Templates** - Lead responses, follow-ups, objection handling
3. **Market Updates** - PDF summarization for sphere of influence
4. **Social Media Posts** - Multi-channel content from single source
5. **Lead Triage** - Qualification questions and CRM notes
6. **Transaction Coordination** - Handoff summaries, status updates
7. **FAQ Responses** - Common questions with personalized touches
8. **Objection Scripts** - Pre-prepared responses to common concerns

### What Makes a Good Capstone Job
✅ Repeatable (you do it multiple times per week/month)
✅ Time-consuming (currently takes 15-30+ minutes)
✅ Clear inputs (you have all the facts needed)
✅ Verifiable outputs (you can fact-check results)
✅ Low risk (not client-facing decisions, just content/coordination)

### What Makes a Poor Capstone Job
❌ One-time task (won't use system again)
❌ Requires judgment AI can't make (pricing strategy, negotiation tactics)
❌ No clear inputs (too vague or open-ended)
❌ High stakes (legal advice, compliance decisions)
