## CARD 1: LISTING DESCRIPTION CRISIS

### SITUATION (Front)
Your seller demands a listing description by 2 PM today for a property you just saw this morning. It's a 3-bed/2-bath ranch in a transitional neighborhood - some homes beautifully renovated, others rundown. The home has great bones but needs cosmetic updates.

**YOUR TASK:**
Use AI to draft a response email that:
- Acknowledges their specific questions

You're listing a property that's hard to categorize: a converted barn on 2 acres, zoned for horses, with a main house and separate studio. It's gorgeous but appeals to a very specific buyer.

## CARD 9: FRAUD DETECTION CHALLENGE

### SITUATION (Front)
You receive an email that appears to be from your transaction coordinator, asking you to update wire instructions for a closing happening in 3 days. The email looks legitimate but something feels slightly off - there's unusual urgency and a request to "reply ASAP, don't call, I'm in meetings all day."

**YOUR TASK:**

**YOUR TASK:**
Choose 3 common questions and use AI to:
- Draft a clear, accurate answer (100-150 words each)

## CARD 11: OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPT

### SITUATION (Front)
You keep encountering the same seller objection during listing presentations: "But the Zillow Zestimate says my home is worth $50K more than your CMA." You need a clear, respectful response that educates without insulting the seller or Zillow.

**YOUR TASK:**
Use AI to create:
- A 3-sentence response explaining CMA vs. Zestimate
- Supporting points about data sources and accuracy

Currently you write this manually from the contract. It takes 15 minutes per deal.

**YOUR TASK:**
Use AI to create a template prompt you can reuse for every transaction handoff:
- Extracts key details from contract (when you paste it)
