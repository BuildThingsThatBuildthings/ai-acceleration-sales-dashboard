#### General Purpose AI (Text Generation)
| Tool | Best For | Free Tier | Paid Price | Privacy |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) | Versatile content creation, prompting practice | Yes (GPT-3.5) | $20/mo (GPT-4) | Standard - don't paste PII |
| **Claude** (Anthropic) | Long documents, detailed analysis, context-aware | Yes (limited) | $20/mo (Pro) | Standard - don't paste PII |
| **Gemini** (Google) | Integration with Google Workspace | Yes | Varies | Standard - Google ToS |

**Workshop Recommendation:** Start with ChatGPT free tier or Claude for learning. Upgrade to paid when ROI is clear.

#### Desktop AI (File Processing)
| Tool | Best For | Platform | Price |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| **Claude Desktop** | PDFs, images, screenshots | Mac/Windows | $20/mo |

## TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQ

### Common Issues

**"AI outputs are still generic"**
→ Add more context. Use your Voice & Tactics Card with every prompt. Include specific facts and constraints.

**"I'm not saving time yet"**
→ Normal in first 2 weeks. Focus on 1-2 jobs only. Refine prompts until they're consistently good. Time savings come after setup.

**"My team won't adopt AI"**
→ Start with yourself. Show results, not theory. Share before/after examples. Address specific concerns (job security, complexity).

**"I'm worried about compliance"**
→ Always verify AI outputs. Use Fair Housing checklist. When in doubt, consult your broker. Save AI outputs with source documents.

**"Which tool should I use?"**
→ Start with ChatGPT free tier. Use for 2 weeks. If you need file processing, upgrade to Claude or ChatGPT Plus. Avoid tool-hopping.

**"AI made a factual error"**
→ Expected behavior. Never trust AI facts without verification. Build verification checkpoints into every prompt.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

You took the first step by attending the workshop. Now comes the real work: implementation.

Remember:
- Start small (1-2 jobs only)
- Ship small (iterate fast)
- Verify always (AI is not truth)
- Measure ruthlessly (time saved = success)
- Share generously (community grows stronger together)

**The agents who win with AI aren't the ones who know the most - they're the ones who DO the most.**

See you in the community. Let's build something great.
