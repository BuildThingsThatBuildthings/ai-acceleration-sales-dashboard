## 2) Learning Outcomes → Assessments

- **Explain AI & fit** → 3 “spot the fit/misfit” scenarios; call on table leads for rationale.
- **Iterative prompting** → Mini-drill: v1→v2→v3 within 7 minutes; score for clarity & constraints.
- **Context engineering** → Submit a filled “Voice & Tactics Card”; graded on completeness & specificity.
- **Job identification** → Submit a two-pilot job sheet; must include success metric & time saved.
- **Tool selection** → Choose 1 tool per pilot via decision tree; justify with job, privacy, cost.
- **Fraud awareness** → 6-item checklist quiz using realistic fakes; pass ≥5/6.
- **Desktop AI use** → Live task: extract 7 key fields from a sample PDF/image and draft the reply.

---

## 3) Exercises (ready to run)

### A. Prompting Mini-Drills (10:35–11:10)

- **Drill 1 (Clarity Pass):** Turn “help me write a listing” into a tight ask with audience, channel, facts, style, exclusions.
  _Rubric:_ has audience, channel, facts, style, exclusions (5 pts).
- **Drill 2 (Constraint Layering):** Add 3 constraints (length limit, tone, local detail) and 2 “do-not-say” items.
- **Drill 3 (Iteration):** Improve v1 → v3 via “tighten”, “add objection rebuttal”, “remove fluff”.

### B. Context Card Build (11:10–11:50)

- **Template fields:** Voice pillars; taboo phrases; CTA hierarchy; top 10 buyer/seller objections + 1-line rebuttals; micro-geography cheats (school zones, commute, HOA quirks); formatting preferences; compliance notes.
- **Deliverable:** 1-page PDF/Doc.
- **Usage:** Paste as preface to any prompt.

### C. Job Scan Workshop (1:00–1:35)

- **For each job:** Current steps, owner, pain, minutes/week, risk, measurable outcome.
- **Pick 2 pilots:** Must save ≥30 min/week and be low risk to ship.

### D. Fraud Awareness Demos (2:10–2:40)

- **Text:** Phishing email mimicking title officer—spot metadata mismatch + urgent wire transfer.
- **Voice:** Voicemail “broker” with cloned voice—validate with known callback & code word.
- **Image:** “Repaired” listing photo—identify cloned lawn/sky, lens inconsistencies.

## 5) Sample, Copy-Paste-Ready Prompts (RE-specific)

> Use these in drills/demos. They match your style: precise, constraints-heavy, verifiable.

**1) Listing Description Draft (with compliance guardrails)**

```
You are my real-estate copy assistant. Write a 120–150 word listing description for [address], targeting [buyer persona]. Facts (non-negotiable): [beds], [baths], [sqft], [lot], [year], [updates], [school zone], [HOA details].
Style: concise, local nuance, no puffery, no unverifiable claims, avoid Fair Housing risk language, avoid steering.
Include: 1 line on location benefits (commute/parks), 1 line on unique features, 1 optional note on recent updates with dates.
Exclude: superlatives unless sourced; demographic descriptors; any promises.
Finish with: neutral CTA to schedule a showing via known brokerage channel.
At the end, list the 3 facts you used in [FACT CHECK] brackets for verification.
```

**2) Price-Reduction Email to Sellers (objection-aware)**

```
Draft an email for sellers at [address] proposing a [X%] price adjustment.
Constraints: respectful, data-led, 140–180 words, 1 paragraph + bullet list.
Include: 3 comps with days-on-market, list-to-sale ratio, and one sentence on buyer feedback trend.
Handle the objection: “We can wait for the right buyer.”
End with 2 scheduling options for a 10-min call and a link to the updated CMA.
```

**3) Lead Intake → Triage**

```
Summarize this inquiry in 5 bullets: budget, timing, must-haves, location constraints, financing status.
Then produce:
- A 2-sentence reply acknowledging specifics,
- 3 clarifying questions,
- A CRM note in one line,
- A follow-up task with due date.
Input: [pasted lead email or transcript].
```

**4) Market PDF → Seller One-Pager**

```
From this market report PDF, extract: median sale price 90-day trend, DOM trend, inventory change YoY, list-to-sale ratio, and one risk/opportunity insight for [neighborhood].
Write a 120-word seller briefing with a neutral tone. Include a [SOURCE] section with page numbers for each stat.
```

**5) Fraud Check Gate for Wire Instructions**

```
Analyze this email for fraud risk. Output a checklist with pass/fail for: sender domain match, previous thread continuity, unusual urgency, wire changes vs last instructions, grammar anomalies, attachment type, request to bypass normal chain.
Return: a risk score 0–5 and the exact next-step verification via known channel (no replies to this thread).
```

---

## 6) Tooling & Stack (keep it tiny)

- **Desktop AI app** that supports: local files, screenshots, PDFs, images, and quick hotkey invoke.
- **Connectors (plain-English use):** email copy/paste, PDF/image drop, optional calendar/notes.
- **Policy Rails:** always include a verification step + [FACT CHECK] block in outputs.
- **Data Handling:** no uploading client PII to unknown tools; anonymize addresses in demos.

_(We can slot in specific apps you already use; the pedagogy doesn’t depend on brand names.)_

---

## 7) Compliance & Risk Notes (RE-specific)

- **Fair Housing:** avoid demographic descriptors, “family-friendly,” “safe,” etc. Stick to property facts & location features.
- **Advertising/MLS:** no unverifiable claims; align with local MLS photo/editing rules; label enhancements/staging.
- **Wire Fraud:** never approve via email alone; “verify via known channel” SOP in slides & handouts.
- **Record-keeping:** save AI outputs + sources in the transaction file (text, docs, screenshots).

---

## 8) Instructor Prep (7-day checklist)

- Collect 3 anonymized market PDFs, 2 anonymized listing photo sets, 3 real email threads (scrubbed).
- Pre-load demo workflows (keyboard macro for “drop → summarize”).
- Print/prepare: all handouts + QR bundle to a resource hub.
- Test projector + audio + Wi-Fi; bring offline backups.
- Whiteboard columns: “Jobs → Minutes Saved → Pilot Candidates.”
- Set a timer for each drill to keep pace.

---

## 9) Deliverables You’ll Hand to WCAR

1. Slide deck (lightweight, mostly demos).
2. 6 handouts (PDF + printable).
3. Capstone Pack template folder (zip).
4. Post-class email with links, recap, and a 30-day “ship small” challenge.
5. Feedback form (QR) + certificate template (optional CE credit coordination if needed).

---

## 10) Measurement & Follow-Up

- **Exit ticket (4:00):** each attendee writes their two pilot jobs + time saved target.
- **7-day check-in email:** prompt them to report minutes saved & one barrier.
- **30-day challenge:** submit before/after artifact for 1 pilot; spotlight winners in WCAR newsletter.
- **KPIs:** % who implemented ≥1 pilot, average minutes saved/week, repeat bookings.

## 11) Marketing Blurb for WCAR (copy-ready)

**AI Acceleration: Practical AI for Real Estate (1-Day Workshop)**
Cut through the noise and ship results. In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn how to think about AI, prompt it clearly, feed it the right context, and deploy it on the jobs that actually save you time: lead triage, listing prep, market digests, emails that get answers, and more. We’ll keep the tool stack tiny, emphasize safety (fraud checks, compliance), and build a repeatable mini-system you can use the next morning. Bring a laptop (optional). Leave with templates, checklists, and a measurable plan.

---

## 12) What I’ll Build Next for You (assets checklist)

- [ ] Slide deck (≤40 slides, demo-first)
- [ ] 6 handouts (PDF)
- [ ] Capstone templates (prompt.md, context.md, metrics.md)
- [ ] 12 scenario cards (fit/misfit, fraud, objections)
- [ ] Instructor notes + timing script
