Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Introduction to Mental Models
Subtitle: Unlocking Superior Decision-Making
Design: Use a clean, modern background with shades of blue and green. Include the course logo and title in Montserrat font for emphasis.
Slide 2: What Are Mental Models?
Heading: Defining Mental Models
Content: Explain mental models as frameworks that help us simplify and interpret the real world to make better decisions. Use a quote from a renowned thinker like Charlie Munger or Daniel Kahneman to add authority.
Visuals: Include an illustrative diagram showing a complex decision simplified through a mental model.Visual: Create a simple yet effective infographic that illustrates the concept of a mental model. For example, depict a complex network of thoughts leading into a funnel and emerging as a streamlined thought process. This could represent how mental models simplify complex information.
Citation: Kahneman, D. (2011). Thinking, fast and slow.

Slide 3: The Role of Mental Models in Decision-Making
Heading: Enhancing Decision-Making through Mental Models
Content: Discuss how mental models provide a structured approach to analyzing and solving problems by filtering out noise and focusing on relevant information.
Visuals: Use icons to depict various decision-making scenarios (e.g., business, personal life, technology).
Slide 4: Practical Applications of Mental Models
Heading: Mental Models in Action
Content: Provide examples of different mental models and their applications in real-world scenarios, such as the OODA Loop in military strategies and the Pareto Principle in business.
Visuals: Comparative graphics showing decisions made with and without mental models.
Comparative Graphics for Mental Models
Graphic 1: Business Strategy Decisions
With Mental Models: Illustrate a streamlined decision-making process using a flowchart, where decisions are made using the Pareto Principle (focusing on the 20% of efforts that lead to 80% of results). Highlight areas with effective resource allocation and strategic focus.
Without Mental Models: Contrast this with a cluttered flowchart showing scattered efforts with little to no focus, leading to diluted resources and suboptimal outcomes.
Graphic 2: Personal Finance Management
With Mental Models: Use the mental model of "Opportunity Cost" to show a person efficiently managing their budget, emphasizing savings and investment. Visualize someone planning their expenditures with a clear priority on long-term financial health.
Without Mental Models: Display a chaotic financial situation where spontaneous spending leads to financial instability and lack of savings, emphasizing short-term desires over long-term needs.
Graphic 3: Daily Task Organization
With Mental Models: Apply the "Eisenhower Box" model to categorize tasks into urgent/not urgent and important/not important. Show a daily planner that's organized with tasks neatly scheduled according to priority.
Without Mental Models: Portray a disorganized planner with tasks all marked as urgent, leading to stress and inefficiency as the person struggles to manage time.
Graphic 4: Problem Solving in a Work Environment
With Mental Models: Demonstrate the use of "First Principles Thinking" where a complex problem is broken down into fundamental principles before forming a solution, leading to innovative and effective problem-solving.
Without Mental Models: Show a meeting where participants throw generic solutions at a complex problem without understanding the root causes, resulting in ineffective solutions that don’t address the core issues.
Design Tips:
Color Coding: Use distinct colors to differentiate between scenarios with and without mental models—perhaps green for scenarios with mental models to symbolize effectiveness and red for those without to indicate caution.
Icons and Symbols: Use clear icons to represent different scenarios—like a light bulb for ideas, check marks for effective decisions, and cross marks for poor decisions.
Layout Consistency: Keep the layout consistent across comparisons to help the audience easily understand the contrast between the effective use of mental models and the lack thereof.

Slide 5: Interactive Activity Introduction

Loom Video Script: Module 1 - Mental Models
Introduction (0:00-0:30)
"Hello and welcome to our module on Mental Models! I’m [Your Name], and today we’ll explore how mental models can transform your decision-making process. Let’s dive in!"
Defining Mental Models (0:30-1:00)
"Mental models are like shortcuts for our brain. They help us quickly understand and navigate complex situations. As Daniel Kahneman highlights in his book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow,' they are the tools that shape how we engage with the world around us."
Enhancing Decision-Making (1:00-1:30)
"Why are mental models essential? They refine our thinking and decision-making abilities, allowing us to ignore irrelevant details and focus on what truly matters. Whether in business strategy or everyday choices, they are invaluable."
Practical Applications (1:30-2:00)
"Consider the Pareto Principle, which suggests that 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. This model can guide us to focus on the most impactful activities. Similarly, the OODA Loop model helps in quick decision-making under fast-changing conditions."
Interactive Activity (2:00-2:30)
"Now, it’s your turn! I've prepared a Google Docs template where you can reflect on the mental models we discussed today. You’ll find the link in the description below. I encourage you to document your thoughts and examples of how you might apply these models in your life or work."
Conclusion and Q&A (2:30-3:00)
"Thank you for participating! Please feel free to ask questions or share your thoughts in the chat. Engaging with these concepts is the first step towards making better decisions. I look forward to hearing your insights!"
