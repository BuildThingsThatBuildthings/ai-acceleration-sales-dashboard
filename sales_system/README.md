# AI Acceleration Sales System

## Core Framework: CLOSER + High-Ticket (Hormozi + Becker)

### Primary: CLOSER Framework (Alex Hormozi)
```
C - CLARIFY      → Deep discovery (understand their world)
L - LABEL        → Name + quantify their problem
O - OVERVIEW     → Explore past failures (why nothing worked)
S - SELL VACATION → Paint outcomes, not features
E - EXPLAIN      → Preempt top 3 concerns
R - REINFORCE    → Make them close themselves
```

### Secondary: High-Ticket Positioning (Alex Becker)
```
H - HIGH-VALUE POSITIONING → You solve expensive problems
T - TIMELINE URGENCY       → AI is moving fast, waiting costs
C - CONSULTANT, NOT SELLER → You're qualifying THEM
```

### Core Principles
1. **"Sell the vacation, not the plane ride"** - Focus on Monday morning, not the workshop
2. **10% words, 90% tonality** - Conviction > script perfection
3. **You're the prize** - You're selecting clients, not begging for them
4. **Discovery over pitching** - Listen 60%, talk 40%

## The 4 Supporting Frameworks (Still Valuable)

### 1. PACE (Your Call Structure)
```
P - Pattern Interrupt    "I saw [Hook]..."
A - Ask Permission       "Mind if I ask one question?"
C - Clarify Pain         "What's your biggest bottleneck?"
E - Explain Value        "Here's what we do..."
→ CLOSE:                 "[Day 1] or [Day 2]?"
```

### 2. The $500 Math (Say This Exactly)
```
"If AI saves each agent 5 hours a week,
that's $500 a month per agent.
For 10 agents, that's $60K a year.
The workshop pays for itself month one."
```

### 3. EIR (Handle Any Objection)
```
E - Empathize   "I hear you..."
I - Isolate     "Is it [X] or [Y]?"
R - Reframe     "Here's another way to look at it..."
```

### 4. The 3-3-3 Rule (Daily Activity)
```
3 hours of calls = 40 dials
3 outcomes matter = Connected / VM / Bad Data
3 daily goals = 15 convos, 2 bookings, 5 follow-ups
```

## Quick Start (5 Minutes to First Call)

### 1. Open Your Lead Sheet
The Google Sheet has 500+ leads with:
- **First Name, Last Name**: The decision maker
- **AI Subject Line**: Reference this in your opening
- **AI Opening Hook**: Your pattern interrupt (read it verbatim)
- **Status**: Update after every call

### 2. Your Daily Rhythm
```
8:30 AM   Pull 25 leads marked "Lead" (uncontacted)
9-11 AM   Call Block 1 - Work through list
11 AM     Check Instantly for email openers (hot leads)
1-3 PM    Call Block 2 - Email openers + callbacks
3:30 PM   Update all notes, schedule tomorrow
```

### 3. Your Opening (Word-for-Word)
```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.
I sent you an email about [read AI Subject Line].
Did you have a chance to look at it?"
```

If they say NO:
```
"No worries. Quick version: We do one-day AI workshops for
brokerages. Agents leave with systems they use Monday morning.
Worth 2 minutes to explain?"
```

### 4. The Close
```
"I've got availability [dates]. Would [Day 1] or [Day 2] work
better for a 15-minute call to walk through the curriculum?"
```

### 5. After Every Call
Update the sheet:
- **Status**: Lead → Contacted → Booked → Closed
- **Call Notes**: What they said, objections, pain points
- **Follow Up Date**: If scheduling callback

## Conviction Affirmations (Read Before Calls)

1. I have something valuable. I'm here to see if they qualify.
2. The math is simple. It either makes sense or it doesn't.
3. I'm helping, not selling.
4. Conviction corrects tonality.
5. The workshop is one day. The results are permanent.
6. I solve a $130,000 problem. My solution is $5,000. The math works.
7. Not everyone qualifies. That's by design.
