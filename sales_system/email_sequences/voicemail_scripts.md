# Voicemail Scripts

## The Reality

60-70% of calls go to voicemail. Make them count.

## Voicemail Best Practices

### Keep It Short
- **Target:** 20-30 seconds max
- **Never exceed:** 45 seconds
- **Why:** Long voicemails get deleted without listening

### Sound Human
- Smile while recording (they can hear it)
- Don't read robotically
- Use natural pauses
- Sound like you're talking to a friend

### Leave a Clear CTA
- Your name and company
- Why you're calling (briefly)
- Your phone number (slowly, twice)
- Best time to reach you

## Primary Voicemail Script

Use for first voicemail:

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.

I'm calling because [one line from AI Opening Hook].

I help brokerages like [Casual Company] get their agents
using AI in ways that actually save time.

Give me a call back at [Your Number].
Again, that's [Your Number].

Talk soon!"
```

**Example:**
```
"Hi Sarah, this is John with AI Acceleration.

I'm calling because I saw Semonin had a record year—
congrats on leading that team.

I help brokerages like Semonin get their agents
using AI in ways that actually save time.

Give me a call back at 615-555-1234.
Again, that's 615-555-1234.

Talk soon!"
```

## Alternative Scripts

### Script 2: The Follow-Up VM
For second attempt (if they didn't call back):

```
"Hi [First Name], [Your Name] again from AI Acceleration.

I left you a message last week about AI training
for your agents. Wanted to try you one more time.

If it's not a fit, no worries—just let me know.
Otherwise, I'm at [Your Number].

Have a great day!"
```

### Script 3: The Value VM
When you want to lead with specific value:

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.

Quick question: Are your agents spending 30+ minutes
on listing descriptions? We help cut that to 5 minutes.

If that's interesting, give me a call at [Your Number].

Thanks, [First Name]!"
```

### Script 4: The Curiosity VM
Creates intrigue:

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name].

I have a quick question about something I noticed
at [Company]. Call me back at [Your Number]
and I'll explain.

Looking forward to it!"
```

### Script 5: The Referral VM
If you have a mutual connection:

```
"Hi [First Name], this is [Your Name] with AI Acceleration.

[Referrer Name] suggested I give you a call—
said you might be interested in what we're doing
with AI training for brokerages.

Give me a call at [Your Number].
Mention [Referrer Name] and I'll know what it's about.

Talk soon!"
```

## Voicemail Don'ts

### Don't
- Leave voicemails longer than 45 seconds
- Pitch your entire product on voicemail
- Sound desperate or pushy
- Forget to leave your number
- Rush through your phone number
- Leave multiple VMs in one week

### Do
- Sound confident and casual
- Reference something specific (the hook)

- Keep a consistent tone
- Wait 3-5 days between voicemails

---

## Voicemail Frequency

### First Attempt
- Leave voicemail (Script 1)
- Send follow-up email same day

### Second Attempt (3-5 days later)
- Call at different time of day
- Leave voicemail if no answer (Script 2)

### Third Attempt (5-7 days later)
- Try one more time
- Shorter voicemail or no VM
- Send final email ("Should I close your file?")

### After 3 Attempts
- Move to email-only for 2-4 weeks
- Re-engage if they open emails
- Otherwise, deprioritize lead

## Recording Tips

### Before Recording
1. Stand up (more energy in voice)
2. Smile (they can hear it)
3. Take a breath
4. Know their name and hook

### During Recording
1. Start strong (no "um" or "uh")
2. Speak clearly, not too fast
3. Pause after key points
4. Say number slowly at end

### Phone Number Delivery
```
Bad: "Call me at 6155551234" (too fast)

Good: "Call me at 615... 555... 1234.
       Again, that's 615... 555... 1234."
```
