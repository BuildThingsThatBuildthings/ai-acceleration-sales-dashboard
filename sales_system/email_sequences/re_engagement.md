## When to Re-Engage

### Timing Guidelines

| Original Outcome | Wait Period | Re-Engagement Type |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| "Not now, maybe later" | 4-6 weeks | Soft check-in |
| "Check back in Q1" | When they said | Reminder email |
| No response (ghosted) | 3-4 weeks | Break-up email |
| "Not interested" | 3-6 months | New angle email |
| Booked but cancelled | 2 weeks | Reschedule email |

## Re-Engagement Email Templates

### Template 1: Soft Check-In

For leads who said "not now" or "maybe later"

```
Subject: Checking in, [First Name]

[First Name],

We chatted a few weeks ago about AI training for [Company].
You mentioned [what they said - timing issue, etc.].

Wanted to check in—is now a better time?

If so, I'd love to find 15 minutes.
If not, no worries—just let me know when to circle back.

[Your Name]
```

### Template 2: Scheduled Follow-Up

For leads who said "check back in [specific time]"

```
Subject: Following up as promised

[First Name],

Back in [month], you mentioned to reach out in [now].
So here I am!

Quick refresh: We help brokerages like [Company]
get their agents using AI productively.
5-10 hours/week back per agent.

Is this a good time to chat?

[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
```

### Template 3: Break-Up Email

For leads who ghosted after initial outreach

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

[First Name],

I've reached out a few times about AI training
for [Company] but haven't heard back.

I don't want to keep bugging you if it's not a fit.

Just reply with:
- "Yes" if you want to chat
- "Later" if timing is bad
- "No" if I should move on

Either way, I'll respect your answer.

[Your Name]
```

**Why this works:** Creates urgency and gets a definitive answer.

### Template 4: New Angle

For leads who said "not interested" 3+ months ago

```
Subject: Something changed since we last talked

[First Name],

We chatted back in [month] about AI training.
At the time, it wasn't a fit.

Since then, we've added:
- Fraud detection training (wire fraud hit $500M last year)
- Vendor sponsorship model (lenders cover part of cost)
- 3-hour workshop option ($3,000 vs. $5,000)

Any of that change the equation?

[Your Name]
```

### Template 5: Reschedule

For leads who booked but cancelled or no-showed

```
Subject: Let's reschedule

[First Name],

We had a call on the calendar that didn't happen.
No worries—things come up.

Want to find another time?

I have:
- [Day] at [Time]
- [Day] at [Time]

Just reply with what works.

[Your Name]
```

## Trigger-Based Re-Engagement

### When to Send Automatically

**Email engagement trigger:**
If a cold lead opens your email 2+ times →
Send Template 1 (Soft Check-In)

**Company news trigger:**
If you see news about their company →
Send personalized email referencing the news

**Seasonal trigger:**
Q1 (after holidays) → Re-engage "check back next year" leads
Q4 (budget season) → Re-engage "no budget" leads

---

## Re-Engagement Sequences

### Sequence: Win Back Cold Lead

**Email 1 (Week 1):** Break-Up Email (Template 3)
- If they reply → Respond per response handlers
- If no reply → Continue sequence

**Email 2 (Week 2):** New Angle (Template 4)
- If they reply → Respond per response handlers
- If no reply → Continue sequence

**Email 3 (Week 3):** Final Referral Ask
```
Subject: One last thing

[First Name],

I'll stop reaching out after this.

Before I do—do you know any other brokerages
in [City] who might be interested in AI training?

Happy to offer a $250 referral bonus if they book.

Either way, thanks for your time.

[Your Name]
```

**After Sequence:** Archive lead for 6 months, then try again.

## What NOT to Do

### Don't
- Re-engage "Remove me" leads (legal risk)
- Send more than 4 re-engagement emails total
- Use aggressive or guilt-trip language
- Lie about "new" offerings that aren't new
- Re-engage within 2 weeks of last contact

### Do
- Wait appropriate time between contacts
- Offer genuine new value or angle
- Respect their decision if they say no again
- Keep records of all outreach
- Know when to let go

---

## Tracking Re-Engagement

In CRM, track:
- Original outcome and date
- Re-engagement attempts (with dates)
- Response to re-engagement
- Final outcome

```
Notes:
10/15 - Original outreach, "not now, check Q1"
01/06 - Re-engagement email (Template 2)
01/08 - Replied, booked call for 01/12
```
