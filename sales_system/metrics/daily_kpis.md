## Understanding Your Numbers

### Connect Rate

**Formula:** Conversations ÷ Total Calls

| Rate | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| 40%+ | Excellent | Keep doing what you're doing |
| 30-40% | Good | Normal range |
| 20-30% | Below target | Try different times, check data quality |
| <20% | Problem | Review call times, check for bad data |

**Factors affecting connect rate:**
- Time of day (morning vs. afternoon)
- Day of week (Tue-Thu typically best)
- Data quality (wrong numbers)
- Gatekeeper handling

### Book Rate

**Formula:** Demos Booked ÷ Conversations

| Rate | Status | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| 15%+ | Excellent | You're crushing it |
| 10-15% | Good | Solid performance |
| 5-10% | Needs work | Review objection handling |
| <5% | Problem | Script review, coaching needed |

**Factors affecting book rate:**
- Discovery quality (understanding their pain)
- Objection handling (reframes working?)
- Closing technique (asking for the meeting)
- Lead quality (are they decision makers?)

## Daily Diagnostic

### If Connect Rate is Low (<30%)

**Check:**
1. Are you calling during business hours?
2. Is the data quality good? (Wrong numbers?)
3. Are you getting past gatekeepers?
4. Are decision makers available?

**Try:**
- Call earlier (9-10 AM) or later (3-4 PM)
- Vary your days (Tue-Thu typically best)
- Review gatekeeper scripts
- Flag bad data for cleanup

### If Book Rate is Low (<10%)

**Check:**
1. Are you doing enough discovery?
2. Are your objection responses working?
3. Are you asking for the meeting?
4. Are these actual decision makers?

**Try:**
- More discovery questions before pitching
- Review objection library
- Practice closing techniques
- Qualify decision-making authority earlier

### If Both Are Low

**Check:**
1. Is the lead list quality good?
2. Is your energy/confidence up?
3. Are you following the script?
4. Do you need coaching/support?

**Try:**
- Review list source and quality
- Take a break, reset mentally
- Practice script out loud
- Ask for call review/feedback
