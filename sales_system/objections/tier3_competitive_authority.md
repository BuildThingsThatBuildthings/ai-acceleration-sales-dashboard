# Tier 3: Competitive & Authority Objections

These objections require finesse—you're competing against alternatives or navigating decision-making dynamics.

---

## Competitive Objections

### "We already have an AI training vendor"

**What They Mean:**
- They've worked with someone else
- They're comparing you to competition
- They may be satisfied or frustrated

**Response:**
```
"Who are you working with?"

[Listen - don't interrupt]

"Got it. What we do differently is hands-on implementation.
Agents don't just learn concepts—they build working systems
in the workshop. Prompts, voice cards, workflows.
They leave with tools they use Monday morning.

Is that how [Competitor] approached it?"
```

**Follow-Up Questions:**
- *"How's that been going? Are your agents using what they learned?"*
- *"What worked well? What didn't?"*
- *"Would it be worth comparing approaches?"*

**If They're Happy With Competitor:**
```
"That's great—sounds like you made a good choice.
Quick question: Are they covering fraud detection?
That's become critical this year."
```

---

### "Why you instead of [NAR / local association training / online courses]?"

**What They Mean:**
- They see cheaper or "free" alternatives
- They want to understand differentiation
- They may not understand the value gap

**Response:**
```
"Great question. NAR and association training is solid for concepts.
We're implementation.

Your agents leave with:
- Working prompts for their specific workflows
- A Voice Card that makes AI sound like THEM
- Fraud detection protocols they'll actually use

It's the difference between watching a cooking show
and leaving with dinner made."
```

**Alternative Angle:**
```
"Online courses have 5-10% completion rates.
Our workshops have 100% completion because
agents are building live, not watching videos.

Plus, we're on-site. Questions get answered in real-time.
No Googling later—it's done."
```

---

### "We can figure this out ourselves"

**What They Mean:**
- DIY mindset
- Don't see value in outside help
- May have tried and failed

**Response:**
```
"Totally respect that. Some brokerages do.

Quick question: How's it been going so far?
Are your agents consistently using AI,
or is it more sporadic?"

[If sporadic]:
"That's what we see everywhere. The challenge isn't
finding AI tools—it's getting adoption.
That's what we solve. Hands-on training, practical prompts,
systems that stick."
```

**If They Push Back:**
```
"Here's the math: You could spend 20 hours
figuring out what works, testing tools, creating prompts.
Or your agents could have it all in 6 hours,
built by people who've done this dozens of times.
What's 20 hours of your time worth?"
```

---

### "I've seen a lot of AI hype—how is this different?"

**What They Mean:**
- Skeptical of AI marketing
- Burned before
- Need proof, not promises

**Response:**
```
"I hear you—AI hype is everywhere right now.
Here's what's different about us:

1. We're real estate specific. Fraud detection.
   Fair Housing guardrails. Your actual workflows.

2. We're implementation, not theory. Agents leave
   with prompts they use Monday morning.

3. We're on-site. Not a webinar. Not a course.
   Hands-on, supervised, questions answered live.

Would it help to see the curriculum before deciding?"
```

---

## Authority Objections

### "I need to ask the owner / board / partner"

**What They Mean:**
- They can't make the decision alone
- They need internal buy-in
- They may or may not champion it

**Response:**
```
"Totally understand. What would help you make the case to them?

I can send:
- A one-pager with ROI math
- The full curriculum
- A quick video overview

What would be most useful?"
```

**Follow-Up:**
```
"When do you think you'll be able to discuss it with [Owner/Board]?
I can follow up after to answer any questions they have."
```

**Plant the Seed:**
```
"By the way—if they're numbers-focused, here's the quick pitch:
$500 per agent for a full day. 12:1 ROI in year one.
Pays for itself month one.
Feel free to use that."
```

---

### "We're not the decision makers—you need to talk to corporate"

**What They Mean:**
- Franchise or regional structure
- Limited local authority
- Corporate controls training budget

**Response:**
```
"Got it. Who at corporate handles training decisions?
I can reach out to them directly and mention
[Your Name] at [Their Location] flagged this as interesting."
```

**Alternative:**
```
"Has corporate approved any outside training before?
Sometimes it's easier if the request comes from the field
with a specific recommendation. I can help you build that case."
```

---

### "Let me think about it"

**What They Mean:**
- Not ready to commit
- Need more information
- Polite stall

**Response:**
```
"Of course. What specifically would help you decide?
Is it the timing, the investment, or something about the content?"
```

**Based on Their Answer:**

*If timing:*
```
"When would be a better time to revisit this?
I'll put it on my calendar and follow up then."
```

*If investment:*
```
"Totally get it. Would the 3-hour option at $3,000
be easier to commit to as a starting point?"
```

*If content:*
```
"Let me send you the full curriculum.
Take a look and I'll follow up [day] to discuss."
```

### "We tried AI training before and it didn't work"

**What They Mean:**
- Burned before
- Skeptical of training value
- Need to understand what's different

**Response:**
```
"What happened?"

[Listen carefully - note what went wrong]

"Sounds like [summarize their issue].
Here's how we're different:

We don't do webinars or pre-recorded courses.
Your agents build live—prompts, voice cards, workflows.
They leave with tools they USE, not just concepts they heard.

If an agent doesn't use what they learned,
I want to know why. That's on us."
```

---

### "I'm not convinced this is worth my time"

**What They Mean:**
- Skeptical of value
- Protecting their calendar
- Need a compelling reason

**Response:**
```
"Fair. Let me ask: what's your agents' biggest time sink right now?"

[Listen]

"If we could cut that in half, would it be worth one day?"

[If yes]:
"That's exactly what we do. Agents recovering 5-10 hours a week
on listings, emails, social—the admin stuff that eats their time."

[If no]:
"Got it. Maybe this isn't the right time.
When would a productivity boost be more relevant?"
```

---

### "We're too small for this"

**What They Mean:**
- Budget concerns
- Don't see scale benefit
- May feel overlooked

**Response:**
```
"How many agents are you working with?"

[They answer: 5]

"Perfect. Here's the thing—smaller teams often get MORE value.
You're not trying to change a battleship. You can pivot fast.
Get your 5 agents using AI and you have an instant competitive edge.

At $1,000 per agent, even one extra deal per agent this year
covers the investment 10x over."
```

---

### "We're too big for a one-day workshop"

**What They Mean:**
- Logistics concerns
- Can't get everyone together
- Need scalable solution

**Response:**
```
"Good point. How many agents total?"

[They answer: 100]

"For larger teams, we do a few things:
1. Multiple sessions—train in cohorts of 20
2. Train-the-trainer—certify internal coaches
3. Regional rollout—hit different offices on different days

Which approach makes sense for your structure?"
```

| Why not NAR/free options? | "They're concepts. We're implementation." |
| Can figure it out ourselves | "How's it going? Are agents consistently using AI?" |
| AI hype skepticism | "Real estate specific. Implementation. On-site." |
| Need to ask owner/board | "What would help you make the case?" |
| Need to talk to corporate | "Who handles training? I'll reach out." |
| Let me think about it | "What specifically would help you decide?" |
| Tried before, didn't work | "What happened? Here's how we're different..." |
| Not worth my time | "What's your biggest time sink? We cut it in half." |
| Too small | "Smaller teams get MORE value—faster to pivot." |
| Too big | "Multiple sessions, train-the-trainer, or regional rollout." |

## Mindset for Authority Objections

When they say "I need to ask someone else," don't see it as a roadblock.
See it as an opportunity to:

1. **Arm them with ammunition** - Give them the ROI math, the one-pager, the talking points
2. **Get introduced up the chain** - "Can you connect me with [Decision Maker]?"
3. **Position yourself as an ally** - "I can help you build the case"

They're not saying no. They're saying "help me convince my boss."
