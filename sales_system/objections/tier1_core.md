# Tier 1: Core Objections (5 Most Common)

These are the objections you'll hear daily. Master these first.

---

## THE EIR FRAMEWORK (Use for Every Objection)

```
E - EMPATHIZE   → "I hear you..." (don't argue)
I - ISOLATE     → "Is it X or Y?" (find the real issue)
R - REFRAME     → "Here's another way to look at it..." (new perspective)
```

---

## 1. "I'm too busy"

### What They Mean
- Genuine time pressure
- Polite rejection
- Testing if you'll go away

### Reframe
```
"That's exactly why this matters. Your agents are working
60+ hours a week—5-10 of those are admin AI can handle.
One day of training buys back 200+ hours this year.

What's your biggest time sink right now?"
```

### Alternative Responses

**If they seem genuinely rushed:**
```
"Totally understand. When would be a better time
to catch you for 5 minutes?"
```

**If they seem dismissive:**
```
"I hear you. Quick question before I let you go—
are you open to on-site training if the timing worked?"
```

### Key Insight
"Busy" is often a test. If you fold immediately, they know you're not serious. A gentle push shows confidence.

## 2. "We're already using AI"

### What They Mean
- They've tried ChatGPT
- They have some AI tools
- They think they're covered

### Reframe
```
"That's great—you're ahead of most brokerages.
Quick question: Are your agents using AI, or using it well?

Most agents try ChatGPT once, get garbage output, and quit.
We teach systems—prompts, voice cards, workflows.
Turn the toy into a teammate.

What tools are you using now?"
```

### Follow-Up Questions
- *"How consistently are your agents using it?"*
- *"What results are they getting?"*
- *"Have they built reusable prompts or are they starting fresh each time?"*

### Key Insight
"Using AI" usually means "tried ChatGPT once." Dig deeper to expose the gap between "using" and "using well."

## 3. "It's too expensive"

### What They Mean
- $5,000 feels like a lot
- They don't see the ROI
- Budget timing is bad

### Reframe (The ROI Math)
```
"I hear you—$5K is real money. Let me walk through the math:

If AI saves each agent 5 hours a week,
that's $500 a month in recovered productivity per agent.
For a team of 10, that's $60K a year.

The workshop is $5K. That's 12:1 ROI in year one.
It pays for itself in the first month.

What would make this feel like a no-brainer for you?"
```

### Alternative: The Per-Agent Frame
```
"How many agents on your team? [They say 10]

Okay, so that's $500 per agent for a full day.
Compare that to any certification course.
This is hands-on, practical, and they use it Monday morning."
```

### Alternative: The Vendor Sponsor Angle
```
"What if we could offset the cost?
Lenders, title companies, inspectors—they're always
looking for face time with your agents.
They cover $1-2K, your agents get trained.
Would that change the math?"
```

### Key Insight
Price objections are really value objections. Make the ROI undeniable.

## 4. "I have compliance/legal concerns"

### What They Mean
- Worried about AI liability
- Unsure what's allowed
- Risk-averse personality

### Reframe
```
"Smart concern—you should be asking these questions.

Here's how we handle it: We stay in Marketing, Operations,
and Finance. No legal advice, no contract drafting,
no practice of law.

Plus, we cover fraud detection and Fair Housing guardrails.
Your agents learn what NOT to do with AI, which is
just as important as what to do.

What specific concerns are you thinking about?"
```

### Follow-Up
- *"Are you worried about agent liability or brokerage liability?"*
- *"Have you seen the NAR guidance on AI use?"*
- *"What would make you feel comfortable?"*

### Key Insight
Compliance concerns often mask general AI fear. Address the fear by showing you've thought about risk.

## 5. "Just send me some information"

### What They Mean
- Polite brush-off
- Genuinely curious but not ready to talk
- Testing if you're serious

### Reframe
```
"Happy to send that over.

But quick question before I do—are you open to
on-site training if the curriculum fits?
I don't want to waste your time with a PDF
if this isn't a fit."
```

### If They Say "Yes, send it"
```
"Perfect. What's the best email?
[Get email]

I'll send the curriculum and a one-pager with
ROI math. When should I follow up to discuss?"
```

### If They Say "Just send it, we'll see"
```
"Got it. I'll send it over and follow up [specific day].
If it's not for you, just let me know and I won't bug you."
```

### Key Insight
"Send info" is a sorting mechanism. Qualify their intent before you send. If they won't commit to a follow-up, they're probably not serious.

## Quick Reference Card

| Objection | One-Line Response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Too busy" | "That's exactly why—5-10 hours/week back." |
| "Already using AI" | "Using vs. using well are different. We teach systems." |
| "Too expensive" | "$500/agent. First month pays for itself." |
| "Compliance concerns" | "We stay in Marketing, Ops, Finance. Plus fraud training." |
| "Send info" | "Happy to. Are you open to on-site training if it fits?" |

---

## Practice Drill

Before your first call day, practice these out loud:

1. Say the "too busy" reframe 3 times
2. Say the "already using AI" reframe 3 times
3. Say the ROI math (expense objection) until you can do it without notes
4. Role-play "send info" with a colleague

You should be able to deliver these without thinking.
