# Closing Techniques

## The Mindset

Closing isn't manipulation—it's helping them make a decision.
If they have a problem you can solve, help them say yes.

---

## When to Close

### Close signals (they're ready):
- Asking about specifics (price, timing, logistics)
- Talking about their team ("My agents would love this")
- Future language ("When would we do this?")
- Objections decrease or disappear
- Nodding, engaged body language

### Not ready yet:
- Still asking basic questions
- Bringing up new objections
- Distracted or disengaged
- Hasn't confirmed the problem

**Rule:** Don't close before you've qualified the pain and confirmed the fit.

## Primary Closing Techniques

### 1. The Direct Ask
Simple, confident, no tricks.

```
"This sounds like a fit. Ready to get on the calendar?"
```

**When to use:** When they've expressed clear interest.

### 2. The Alternative Close
Give two options, both lead to yes.

```
"I have availability [Day 1] and [Day 2].
Which works better for your team?"
```

**When to use:** After pitch, when they seem interested but haven't committed.

### 3. The Assumptive Close
Act as if they've already decided.

```
"Great—so we'll plan for a Tuesday or Wednesday.
How many agents should I expect in the room?"
```

**When to use:** When close signals are strong.

### 4. The Summary Close
Recap value, then ask.

```
"So to recap: 5-10 hours back per agent per week,
fraud training that protects your brokerage,
and a recruiting edge over other firms.

Sound like it's worth exploring?
Let's find a time to walk through the details."
```

**When to use:** After a long conversation, to refocus.

### 5. The Trial Close
Test the water without full commitment.

```
"Does this sound like something that could help [Company]?"
```

If yes → Move to direct or alternative close
If no → "What's missing?" → Address, then try again

**When to use:** When you're unsure if they're ready.

## Urgency & Scarcity (Use Honestly)

### Calendar Scarcity
```
"I'm booking into [month] right now.
If you want to get in before [busy season / Q1 / etc.],
we should lock in a date soon."
```

### Seasonal Urgency
```
"Most brokerages train during the slow season
so they're ready when things heat up.
Right now is the perfect window."
```

### Team Availability
```
"We only do one workshop per week to keep quality high.
[Month] is filling up—when would work for your team?"
```

**Never:** Make up fake urgency. It damages trust.

---

## Closing After Objections

### After Handling Budget Objection
```
"So if the ROI math works—and it does—
what's holding us back from getting started?"
```

### After Handling Time Objection
```
"Sounds like the 3-hour option is more realistic.
Should I pencil that in for [month]?"
```

### After Handling Skepticism Objection
```
"I'll send you those prompts to try.
In the meantime, let's tentatively plan for [date].
If the prompts don't work, we can cancel. Fair?"
```

---

## Handling the Stall

### "I need to think about it"

**Option 1: Isolate the concern**
```
"Of course. What specifically are you weighing?
Is it the timing, the investment, or something about the content?"
```

**Option 2: Schedule the follow-up**
```
"Makes sense. When should I follow up?
I can call you [specific day] to answer any questions."
```

**Option 3: Soft close anyway**
```
"I get it. Tell you what—let me send you the curriculum
and some availability. Take a look, and if it makes sense,
we'll lock in a date. Sound fair?"
```

### "Let me talk to my partner/board"

```
"Totally understand. What would help you make the case?
I can send a one-pager with ROI math and curriculum overview."
```

Then:
```
"When do you think you'll be able to discuss?
I can follow up [day] to answer any questions they have."
```

### "Can you call me next week?"

```
"Absolutely. [Day] work? What time is best?
I'll put it on my calendar and call you then."
```

**Always:** Get a specific day and time, not "sometime next week."

---

## The Follow-Up Close

If they didn't commit on the first call:

### Email Same Day
```
Subject: Next steps for [Company]

[First Name],

Great talking with you.

As discussed:
- 6-hour AI workshop, on-site
- 5-10 hours/week saved per agent
- $5,000 investment (or $3,000 for 3-hour version)

I have [dates] available.
Let me know which works and I'll send a calendar invite.

[Your Name]
[Your Phone]
```

### Follow-Up Call (3-5 Days Later)
```
"Hi [First Name], following up on our conversation.
Had a chance to think it over?
Any questions I can answer?"
```

---

## Closing for the Demo (Not the Sale)

If you're booking a demo call, not the workshop itself:

### Demo Close
```
"Let me find 15 minutes to walk you through the curriculum.
If it's a fit, great. If not, no hard feelings.
I have [Day] at [Time] or [Day] at [Time]. Which works?"
```

### Why It Works
- Lower commitment than full workshop
- Easy to say yes to "15 minutes"
- You can close the workshop on the demo call

---

## Closing Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't
- Close before they've expressed the problem
- Use high-pressure tactics
- Argue when they say no
- Forget to ask at all (most common mistake)
- Accept vague follow-ups ("let's talk sometime")

### Do
- Close confidently, not desperately
- Give them options
- Accept no gracefully
- Always get a specific next step
- Follow up when you said you would

---

## The "Why Not" Close

If you've tried everything:

```
"[First Name], I've shared the ROI, the curriculum,
the time savings. Help me understand—
what's the real blocker here?"
```

**Listen carefully.** Their answer tells you:
- If there's a real objection to address
- If they're just not a fit
- If there's a decision maker you haven't reached

## The Most Important Rule

**ASK.**

Most salespeople don't close because they never ask.
Assume the answer is yes until they tell you otherwise.
Then respect their decision.
