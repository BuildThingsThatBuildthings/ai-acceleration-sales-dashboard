## CLOSER Framework (Hormozi)
```
C → CLARIFY    "What's eating up time?"
L → LABEL      "That's $X lost to admin"
O → OVERVIEW   "What have you tried?"
S → VACATION   "Imagine Monday morning..."
E → EXPLAIN    "You're probably thinking..."
R → REINFORCE  "Does that sound worth 15 min?"
```

## The Opening
```
"Hi [Name], this is [You] with AI Acceleration.
[Read hook from CRM].
I help brokerages get agents using AI that saves time.
Mind if I ask one question?"
```

---

## ROI Math (Memorize)
```
5 hrs/week × $50 × agents × 52 weeks

10 agents = $130K/year value
20 agents = $260K/year value
Workshop = $5K (4% of value)
Payback = Month 1
```
