# Quick Reference Card

Print this. Keep it at your desk. Use it on every call.

## THE PACE FRAMEWORK (Your Call Structure)

```
P - Pattern Interrupt    (15 sec)  "I saw [Hook]..."
A - Ask Permission       (15 sec)  "Mind if I ask one question?"
C - Clarify Pain         (60 sec)  "What's your biggest bottleneck?"
E - Explain Value        (60 sec)  "Here's what we do..."
```

Then close: "I have [Day 1] or [Day 2]. Which works?"

---

## THE 3-3-3 RULE (Daily Activity)

```
3 hours of calls = 40 dials
3 outcomes matter = Connected / VM / Bad Data
3 goals per day = 15 convos, 2 bookings, 5 follow-ups
```

---

## THE HOOK-BRIDGE-CLOSE (Opening Formula)

```
HOOK:   "[AI Opening Hook from sheet]"
BRIDGE: "I help brokerages get agents using AI in ways that save time."
CLOSE:  "Mind if I ask one question?"
```

**Example:**
```
"Hi Sarah, this is John with AI Acceleration.
I saw Semonin had a record year—congrats on leading that.
I help brokerages get agents using AI in ways that save time.
Mind if I ask one question?"
```

---

## THE $500 MATH (Memorize This)

```
5 hours saved/week × $125/hour = $625/month
Conservative estimate = $500/month per agent

10 agents × $500 = $5,000/month value
$5,000/month × 12 = $60,000/year
Workshop cost = $5,000
ROI = 12:1
Payback = Month 1
```

Say it like this:
```
"If AI saves each agent 5 hours a week,
that's $500 a month per agent.
For 10 agents, that's $60K a year.
The workshop pays for itself in month one."
```

---

## THE OBJECTION FORMULA (EIR)

```
E - Empathize   "I hear you..."
I - Isolate     "Is it [X] or [Y]?"
R - Reframe     "Here's another way to look at it..."
```

**Example:**
```
"I hear you—$5K is a real investment.
Is it the total amount, or the timing?
[They answer]
Here's another way to look at it:
That's $500 per agent for a full day.
One extra deal covers it 2x over."
```

## TOP 5 OBJECTIONS (Quick Responses)

| They Say | You Say |

| "Too expensive" | "$500/agent. Pays for itself month one." |
| "Already use AI" | "Using vs. using well. We teach systems." |
| "Send info" | "Happy to. Open to on-site training if it fits?" |
| "Think about it" | "What specifically? Timing, cost, or content?" |

## THE VALUE STACK (3 Layers)

When pitching, stack these benefits:

```
Layer 1: TIME
"5-10 hours back per week per agent"

Layer 2: MONEY
"$500/month per agent in recovered productivity"

Layer 3: PROTECTION
"Fraud detection training—$500M stolen last year"
```

---

## THE TEMPERATURE CHECK (Lead Priority)

```
HOT  = Email reply, referral, asked for call → CALL NOW
WARM = Opened email 2x, 10+ agents → CALL TODAY
COLD = No engagement, unknown → FILL GAPS
```

---

## THE CLOSE MENU (Pick One)

```
DIRECT:      "Ready to get on the calendar?"
ALTERNATIVE: "[Day 1] or [Day 2]—which works?"
ASSUMPTIVE:  "How many agents should I expect?"
SUMMARY:     "So to recap... worth exploring?"
TRIAL:       "Does this sound like it could help?"
```

## THE GOLDEN RULES

1. **Read the Hook** before every dial
2. **Ask, don't tell** (discovery before pitch)
3. **Update CRM** immediately after each call
4. **Close or schedule** (never end without next step)
5. **Move fast** (momentum > perfection)
