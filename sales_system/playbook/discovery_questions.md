# Discovery Questions Framework

## Purpose

Discovery questions help you:
1. Understand their real problems (not surface objections)
2. Qualify if they're the right fit
3. Tailor your pitch to their specific situation
4. Build rapport through genuine curiosity

**Rule: Ask more than you talk. Listen more than you pitch.**

## The Discovery Flow

### Phase 1: Open-Ended Exploration (30-60 seconds)

Start broad, let them talk.

```
"What's your biggest bottleneck right now—
marketing, operations, or agent productivity?"
```

Alternative openers:
- *"If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing at [Company], what would it be?"*
- *"What's keeping you up at night as far as your team goes?"*
- *"What's the biggest challenge your agents are facing right now?"*

**Then: SHUT UP and listen.** Take notes. Don't interrupt.

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (60-90 seconds)

Based on what they said, go deeper.

**If they mentioned PRODUCTIVITY:**
```
"Tell me more about that. Where are your agents losing time?
Is it the admin stuff—listings, emails—or something else?"
```

**If they mentioned TRAINING:**
```
"What training have you tried before? What worked, what didn't?"
```

**If they mentioned AI:**
```
"Interesting. What's been your experience with AI so far?
Have your agents tried any tools?"
```

**If they mentioned COMPETITION:**
```
"What are you seeing from other brokerages in [City]?
Are they ahead on AI, or is everyone figuring it out?"
```

### Phase 3: Qualification (30 seconds)

Confirm they're worth pitching.

```
"How many agents do you have on your team?"
```

Follow-ups:
- *"Who typically makes decisions on training like this?"*
- *"What's your timeline for addressing this?"*
- *"Is this a priority right now, or more of a 'someday' thing?"*

## Question Bank by Topic

### Agent Productivity

```
"How much time do your agents spend on listing descriptions?"
"What about follow-up emails—how long does that take them?"
"Do they have a system, or does everyone do it differently?"
"Who are your top performers, and what do they do differently?"
"What happens during peak season? Do things fall through the cracks?"
```

### AI Experience

```
"Have you or your agents tried any AI tools?"
"What happened? Did they stick with it?"
"What went wrong—was it the output quality, or something else?"
"Do you have any agents who are AI enthusiasts? AI skeptics?"
"What would make AI worth investing in for your team?"
```

### Training History

```
"What training have you done in the last year?"
"How much of it are your agents actually using?"
"What made it stick—or not?"
"Do your agents prefer hands-on or lecture-style training?"
"What's the hardest part about getting everyone trained?"
```

### Competition & Market

```
"What are other brokerages in [City] doing with AI?"
"Do you feel ahead, behind, or about the same?"
"What would give you an edge right now?"
"How important is being first vs. being careful?"
```

### Budget & Timing

```
"Is training something you budget for annually?"
"Who else would need to sign off on something like this?"
"What's your timeline for making a decision?"
"Is this a 'now' priority or more of a 'next year' thing?"
```

### Team Dynamics

```
"How do your agents typically respond to new tools?"
"Do you have early adopters who'd pilot something new?"
"What's the biggest pushback you'd expect from your team?"
"How do you typically roll out new training or tools?"
```

## Listening for Pain Signals

When they talk, listen for these pain indicators:

### Time Pain
- *"We're drowning in..."*
- *"Takes forever to..."*
- *"Never have time to..."*
- *"Agents are working 60+ hours..."*

**Your follow-up:** "Tell me more about what's eating up all that time."

### Quality Pain
- *"Inconsistent..."*
- *"Varies wildly..."*
- *"Some agents are great, others..."*
- *"We keep getting complaints about..."*

**Your follow-up:** "What would 'consistent' look like for you?"

### Competition Pain
- *"Other brokerages are..."*
- *"We're falling behind..."*
- *"Everyone else seems to..."*
- *"I saw [Competitor] doing..."*

**Your follow-up:** "What would put you ahead of them?"

### Fear Pain
- *"Worried about..."*
- *"Scared of..."*
- *"What if..."*
- *"I don't want to get sued for..."*

**Your follow-up:** "What's your biggest concern there?"

### Frustration Pain
- *"We've tried everything..."*
- *"Nothing works..."*
- *"I'm so sick of..."*
- *"Why can't we just..."*

**Your follow-up:** "What have you tried before? What didn't work?"

## Turning Answers Into Pitch Ammo

| What They Said | What You Pitch |
|----------------|----------------|
| "Listing descriptions take forever" | AI + Voice Card = 5 min/listing |
| "Email follow-up is overwhelming" | AI sequences save 40+ min/day |
| "Social media is a time suck" | Batch a week's content in 30 min |
| "We tried AI and it sucked" | Context engineering = real output |
| "Training never sticks" | Hands-on workshop = Monday morning use |
| "Worried about compliance" | Fair Housing guardrails + fraud training |
| "Tool overload" | 2-3 tool stack, master few, ignore many |
| "Top agents are 3x everyone else" | AI scales best practices to whole team |

## Questions to Avoid

### Don't ask:
- *"Are you interested in AI training?"* (Too easy to say no)
- *"Do you have budget for this?"* (Puts them on defense)
- *"Who's your decision maker?"* (Sounds like sales 101)
- *"What's your biggest problem?"* (Too vague)

### Do ask:
- *"What's your biggest bottleneck—marketing, ops, or productivity?"* (Specific options)
- *"How do you typically handle training investments?"* (Natural)
- *"Who else would want to be part of this conversation?"* (Collaborative)
- *"Where are your agents losing the most time?"* (Specific)

## Discovery Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Talking too much
**Problem:** You ask a question, then answer it yourself.
**Fix:** Ask. Wait. Count to 5 in your head if you have to. Let them fill the silence.

### Mistake 2: Leading questions
**Problem:** "Wouldn't it be great if your agents saved 5 hours a week?"
**Fix:** "How much time do your agents spend on admin tasks?"

### Mistake 3: Skipping discovery
**Problem:** You pitch immediately without understanding their situation.
**Fix:** No pitch until you've asked at least 3 questions.

### Mistake 4: Not taking notes
**Problem:** You forget what they said by the time you pitch.
**Fix:** Write down key phrases while they talk. Use their words back to them.

### Mistake 5: Interrogating
**Problem:** Rapid-fire questions feel like a police interview.
**Fix:** After each answer, acknowledge briefly: "Got it." "Makes sense." "Interesting." Then ask the next question.

## Practice Scenarios

### Scenario 1: They mention productivity
```
Prospect: "My agents are working 60 hours a week and still falling behind."

You: "That's tough. Where are they losing the most time—
is it the admin stuff like listings and emails,
or is it something else?"

[They answer]

You: "And when things fall behind, what happens?
Leads slip through? Quality suffers?"

[They answer]

You: "Makes sense. If we could get them 5-10 hours back
a week, would that make a dent?"
```

### Scenario 2: They mention AI skepticism
```
Prospect: "We tried ChatGPT and it was terrible."

You: "What happened? Was it the output quality,
or did agents just not stick with it?"

[They answer]

You: "Did anyone teach them prompting, or were they
just figuring it out on their own?"

[They answer]

You: "That's actually the most common problem we see.
Most agents try AI without context—that's why
the output is generic. We teach the context part."
```

### Scenario 3: They seem distracted
```
Prospect: "I only have a minute. What is this about?"

You: "Totally respect that. One quick question:
What's your biggest bottleneck right now—
marketing, ops, or agent productivity?

I'll tell you if we can help or not."

[They answer briefly]

You: "Got it. We help with [that exact thing].
When's a better time to give you the full picture?"
```

## The Golden Rule

**The person asking questions controls the conversation.**

Don't be the one answering questions defensively.
Be the one asking questions curiously.

Their answers = your ammunition.
