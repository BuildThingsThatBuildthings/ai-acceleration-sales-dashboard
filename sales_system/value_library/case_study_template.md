## Case Study Template

Use this structure for written case studies:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CASE STUDY: [COMPANY NAME]
[City, State] | [Number] Agents | [Date of Workshop]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE CHALLENGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Describe their situation BEFORE the workshop]
- What problems were they facing?
- How much time were agents losing?
- What had they tried before?
- Why did they decide to invest in training?

Example:
"[Company]'s 15-agent team was struggling with inconsistent
follow-up and listing descriptions that took 30+ minutes each.
Previous training initiatives hadn't stuck, and productivity
varied wildly between agents."


THE SOLUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Describe what we delivered]
- Workshop format and duration
- Key modules covered
- Specific tools or systems implemented
- Any customization for their needs

Example:
"We delivered a 6-hour on-site AI Masterclass covering
prompting fundamentals, context engineering, and fraud detection.
Each agent built a personalized Voice & Tactics Card and
left with ready-to-use prompts for listings, emails, and social."


THE RESULTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Quantify the outcomes]
- Time saved (hours/week)
- Specific improvements
- Adoption rate
- Business impact if available

Example:
Results after 30 days:
• Time saved: 5-7 hours per agent per week
• Tools adopted: ChatGPT Plus (12 agents), Claude (3 agents)
• Adoption rate: 100% using AI weekly, 80% using daily
• Specific win: Listing descriptions down from 30 min to 8 min


TESTIMONIAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"[Direct quote from decision maker - ideally 2-4 sentences]"

— [Name], [Title], [Company]

Example:
"Our agents went from skeptical to enthusiastic in one day.
The prompts for listing descriptions alone have saved hours.
Best training investment we've made this year."

— Sarah Johnson, Managing Broker, ABC Realty


KEY METRICS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Team size: [X] agents
• Time savings: [X] hours/week per agent
• ROI: [X]:1 (first-year projection)
• Recommendation score: [X]/10

## Video Testimonial Questions

If they agree to a video (even a quick Zoom recording):

**Setup:**
- Keep it to 3-5 minutes
- Natural setting (their office)
- Can be smartphone quality—authenticity > polish

**Questions to ask:**
1. "Can you introduce yourself and your brokerage?"
2. "What was your team struggling with before the workshop?"
3. "What stood out most about the training?"
4. "How has your team's AI usage changed since?"
5. "What would you tell another broker considering this?"

**Pro tip:** Don't script their answers. Authentic = believable.

## Using Case Studies in Sales

### In Cold Emails
```
"By the way—[Company] in [City] just told us their agents
are saving 5+ hours a week on listings and emails.
Happy to share what they're doing."
```

### In Calls
```
"We just worked with [Company] in [City].
Their agents were in the same situation—skeptical of AI,
overwhelmed with admin. 30 days later, they're saving
5-7 hours a week per agent. Want to hear how?"
```

### In Objection Handling
```
Prospect: "I'm not sure AI will actually help."

You: "Totally understand. [Company] felt the same way.
Now their agents are saving 5+ hours a week.
Would it help to hear what they did differently?"
```

## Building Social Proof Before Case Studies

Until you have case studies, use these:

### Statistics
- "92% of real estate teams are piloting AI right now"
- "$503M stolen via wire fraud in 2023—agents need training"
- "Agents work 60+ hours—5-10 of those are admin AI can handle"

### Your Own Experience
- "We've built this specifically for real estate workflows"
- "We've trained agents from total beginners to confident users in one day"

### Hypothetical (Honest)
- "Teams we work with typically see 5+ hours saved per agent per week"
- "The ROI math works out to 12:1 for a 10-agent team"
