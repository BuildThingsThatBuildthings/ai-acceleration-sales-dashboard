# Competitive Positioning

## How We're Different

When prospects ask "Why you?" or compare us to alternatives, use this guide.

---

## Our Unique Value Proposition

```
We're not another AI webinar or generic training.
We're hands-on implementation, built for real estate,
delivered on-site. Your agents leave with working systems
they use Monday morning.
```

---

## Competitive Landscape

### Type 1: NAR / Association Training

**What they offer:**
- Generic AI overviews
- CE credit eligible
- Usually free or low cost
- Webinar or conference format

**How we're different:**
```
"NAR and associations are great for concepts.
We're implementation.

They tell you what AI can do.
We help you actually do it.

Your agents leave our workshop with:
- Working prompts they use Monday
- A Voice Card that makes AI sound like them
- Fraud detection protocols

Theory vs. execution. Which do you need?"
```

### Type 2: Online Courses / Self-Paced

**What they offer:**
- Low cost ($50-200)
- Self-paced video
- Broad topics
- 5-10% completion rates

**How we're different:**
```
"Online courses have single-digit completion rates.
People start, life happens, they quit.

Our workshops have 100% completion—because
agents are building live, not watching videos.

Plus we're on-site. Questions answered in real-time.
No Googling later. It's done in the room."
```

### Type 3: Generic AI Training Vendors

**What they offer:**
- Broad AI training
- Not industry-specific
- Usually virtual
- Concepts over implementation

**How we're different:**
```
"Generic AI training teaches ChatGPT basics.
Fine for marketers or accountants.

We're built specifically for real estate:
- Prompts for listing descriptions
- Context for follow-up emails
- Fraud detection training
- Fair Housing guardrails

Your agents don't need to adapt generic training
to their workflows. We've done that already."
```

### Type 4: Tech Vendors (CRM AI, etc.)

**What they offer:**
- AI built into their platform
- Limited to that tool
- Often additional cost
- Vendor lock-in

**How we're different:**
```
"CRM AI is useful—inside that platform.
We teach cross-platform skills.

Prompting works in ChatGPT, Claude, Google—
anywhere. Plus, we cover fraud detection
and security. That's not in any CRM.

Tool skills vs. universal skills.
We teach the universal."
```

They have the prompts, the systems, the knowledge.
That's the goal."
```

## Objection-Specific Positioning

### "We can just use ChatGPT ourselves"

```
"Absolutely—and most do. For about a week.

Then the novelty wears off, the output is generic,
and they go back to doing things the old way.

We teach the missing piece: context engineering.
That's what makes AI actually useful.
Without it, you get garbage out."
```

### "There's free AI training everywhere"

```
"There is. And it's worth exactly what you pay.

Free training is concepts. Overview. Awareness.
'Here's what AI can do.'

We're implementation. 'Here's how YOU do it.'
That's the gap free training doesn't fill."
```

### "Our CRM has AI built in"

```
"Great—use it. Seriously.

But CRM AI is limited to that platform.
We teach prompting skills that work everywhere.
Plus fraud detection, which isn't in any CRM.

Think of it as complementary.
CRM for inside-the-platform. Us for everything else."
```

### "We already did AI training"

```
"Who with? [Listen]

How's adoption been?
Are your agents using it consistently?

If yes—great, you're ahead.
If no—that's exactly what we solve.

We don't just teach. We implement.
Agents leave with systems they actually use."
```
