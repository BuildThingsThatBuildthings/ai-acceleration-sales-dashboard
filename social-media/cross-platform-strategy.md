# Cross-Platform Content Strategy

One visual asset. Platform-specific captions. Maximum efficiency.

---

## The Core Principle

**Create once. Post everywhere. Customize captions.**

Every piece of visual content (video or image) can work across all platforms. What changes is:
- Caption length and style
- Hashtag strategy
- Call to action
- Posting format

## Asset-to-Platform Mapping

### Image Content

## Caption Templates by Platform

### Same Visual, Different Captions

**Example: SF-tip-001 (The One-Prompt Fix)**

---

**TikTok Caption:**
```
One change that makes AI actually useful for real estate 🏠 #realestate #ai #chatgpt #realtor #fyp
```

---

**Instagram Reels Caption:**
```
Stop typing "write me a listing description" 🛑

Here's what to do instead:

Give AI context. Tell it WHO you are. Tell it WHAT you need. Tell it HOW to sound.

Same tool. 10x better output.

Save this for your next listing ⬇️

#realestate #realtor #realestateai #chatgpt #realestatetips
```

---

**YouTube Shorts Description:**
```
The one prompt fix that makes ChatGPT actually useful for real estate agents.

Most agents type "write me a listing description" and get garbage. Here's the fix.

**Facebook Caption:**
```
I keep seeing the same mistake from agents.

They type "write me a listing description" into ChatGPT and get generic garbage. Then they blame the tool.

The tool isn't broken. The instructions are.

Here's the fix:

Give it a role: "You are a luxury real estate copywriter"
Give it context: Your market, the property, the buyer
Give it guidelines: Tone, length, style

Same tool. Completely different output.

Anyone else frustrated with AI giving you robotic content? What have you tried?
```

**LinkedIn Caption:**
```
I watched a top-producing agent struggle with AI last week.

Her prompt: "Write me a listing description."
Her result: Generic garbage.

She blamed ChatGPT. But the tool wasn't the problem.

The instructions were.

Here's what the 17% of agents seeing real AI results do differently:

→ They assign a role: "You are a luxury real estate copywriter"
→ They provide context: Market, property details, target buyer
→ They set guidelines: Voice, tone, length, what to emphasize

Same tool. 10x better results.

Context engineering isn't complicated. It just needs to be taught.

What's been your biggest AI frustration? Comment below—I might address it in my next post.

## Batch Posting Workflow

### Step 1: Create Asset (Once)

Film or generate your visual content. Save with proper naming convention.

### Step 2: Write All Captions (Once)

For each asset, write all 5 platform captions at once. Use the templates above.

**AI Prompt for Caption Batch:**

```
I have a video/image about: [TOPIC/DESCRIPTION]

Write platform-specific captions for:

1. TikTok (1-2 sentences, casual, 3-5 hashtags)
2. Instagram Reels (3-7 sentences, save CTA, 3-5 hashtags)
3. YouTube Shorts (2-4 sentences with subscribe CTA, 3-5 hashtags)
4. Facebook (50-150 words, question at end, 2-3 hashtags)
5. LinkedIn (100-250 words, thought leadership tone, 3-5 hashtags)

Brand voice: Professional but approachable. Educational. Direct.
Business: Real estate AI training for brokerages.
```

### Step 3: Schedule (Once per week)

Use scheduling tools to post across platforms:

| Tool | Platforms |
|------|-----------|
| Meta Business Suite | Facebook, Instagram |
| TikTok Creator Tools | TikTok |
| YouTube Studio | YouTube |
| LinkedIn Native | LinkedIn |
| Later/Buffer | All (paid) |

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### TikTok
- Remove watermarks before cross-posting elsewhere
- Post first to TikTok for native feel
- Use trending sounds when possible

### Instagram
- No TikTok watermarks (algorithm buries them)
- Vertical performs better than square for Reels
- Carousels get 2x the saves

### YouTube
- Shorts must be under 60 seconds
- Add timestamps to longer content
- Thumbnails matter even for Shorts

### Facebook
- Links in comments, not main post
- Native video preferred over links
- Engagement in first 30 min is critical

### LinkedIn
- Longer captions perform better
- Keywords matter more than hashtags now
- Multi-image posts get highest engagement
