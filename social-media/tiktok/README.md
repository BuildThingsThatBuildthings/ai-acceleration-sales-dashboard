## Algorithm Insights (2025)

### Key Ranking Signals

| Signal | Weight | How to Win |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Watch Time | Critical | Hook in first 1-2 seconds |
| Completion Rate | High | Keep videos tight |
| Replays | High | Create "wait what?" moments |
| Shares | Very High | Make it relatable/shareable |
| Comments | High | Ask questions, spark debate |
| Saves | Medium | Educational content |

### The For You Page (FYP)

TikTok tests your video with small groups first:
1. **First 200 views** - Algorithm watches completion rate
2. **If >50% complete** - Pushed to larger audience
3. **Engagement compounds** - Each level unlocks bigger reach
4. **No follower count advantage** - New accounts can go viral

---

## Optimal Video Lengths

| Length | Best For | Algorithm Impact |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| 5-9 sec | Punchy hooks, quick tips | High completion, good for testing |
| 15-30 sec | Standard tips, stories | Sweet spot for most content |
| 60+ sec | Deep dives, tutorials | TikTok now prioritizes longer content |
| 3+ min | Educational series | Unlocked for all users, high watch time |

**2025 Update:** TikTok is pushing longer content. Both 5-9 sec AND 60+ sec perform well.

## Content Strategy

### What Works for B2B on TikTok

| Content Type | Why It Works |
|--------------|--------------|
| Myth-busting | "Everyone thinks X, but actually..." |
| Hot takes | Controversial opinions spark comments |
| Behind-the-scenes | Humanizes business content |
| Duets/Stitches | Leverage existing viral content |
| Story time | "I walked into a brokerage and..." |
| POV videos | Relatable scenarios |

### Content Pillars

| Pillar | % of Posts | Examples |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Pain Points | 30% | "When AI gives you garbage..." |
| Quick Tips | 25% | "The one prompt that changed everything" |
| Stories | 20% | Real brokerage transformation stories |
| Hot Takes | 15% | "Unpopular opinion: most AI training sucks" |
| Promotional | 10% | Workshop announcements |

---

## The Hook (First 1-2 Seconds)

### Hook Formulas That Work

1. **Pattern Interrupt:** Start mid-sentence or mid-action
2. **Bold Claim:** "This one prompt saves 14 hours a week"
3. **Question:** "Why do 83% of brokers fail with AI?"
4. **Controversy:** "AI training is a scam. Here's why."
5. **Story Start:** "So a broker walked up to me and said..."
6. **POV Setup:** "POV: You just saved your team 14 hours"

### Visual Hooks

- Movement in first frame
- Text on screen immediately
- Face close to camera
- Unexpected visual element

---

## Technical Requirements

- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 vertical (full screen)
- **Resolution:** 1080x1920 minimum
- **Captions:** Required (85%+ watch without sound)
- **Native editing:** Use TikTok's editor for algorithm boost
- **Trending sounds:** Check trending page daily
- **Original audio:** Can perform well for educational content

---

## Posting Schedule

**Frequency:** 1-3 videos per day (consistency > quality for growth)

**Best Times:**
- Thursday: 10 AM - 12 PM
- Saturday: 11 AM - 1 PM
- Tuesday-Friday: 7 PM - 9 PM

**First Hour:** Critical for algorithm. Engage with all comments immediately.

---

## Hashtag Strategy

### 2025 Best Practice

- **3-5 hashtags** (not 15-20)
- Mix trending + niche
- TikTok SEO matters - use keywords in captions

### Recommended Hashtags

**Broad:**
- #realestate
- #realtor
- #business
- #ai

**Niche:**
- #realestatebroker
- #brokerlife
- #realestateai
- #aitraining
- #businesstok
- #realestatetips

### Caption Strategy

Keep captions short but keyword-rich:
- "The AI mistake killing your brokerage #realestateai #brokerlife"
- "POV: when ChatGPT actually works #realtor #ai #realestate"

---

## Video Structure Templates

### Quick Tip (15-30 sec)
```
0:00-0:02 - HOOK (bold statement)
0:02-0:05 - CONTEXT (why this matters)
0:05-0:25 - THE TIP (actual value)
0:25-0:30 - CTA (follow for more)
```

### Story Format (30-60 sec)
```
0:00-0:03 - HOOK ("So this happened...")
0:03-0:10 - SETUP (context)
0:10-0:45 - STORY (the narrative)
0:45-0:55 - LESSON (what it means)
0:55-0:60 - CTA
```

### Hot Take (15-45 sec)
```
0:00-0:03 - CONTROVERSIAL HOOK
0:03-0:10 - ESTABLISH POSITION
0:10-0:35 - EVIDENCE/REASONING
0:35-0:45 - INVITATION TO DEBATE
```

---

## Engagement Tactics

### Driving Comments

- End with a question
- Make controversial statements
- Ask "agree or disagree?"
- Use "Comment [WORD] if..."
- Reply to comments with video responses

### Driving Shares

- Create relatable pain points
- Make "tag someone who..." content
- Use humor (even in B2B)
- Create "I need to show my team this" moments

---

## TikTok SEO (2025 Important)

TikTok is now a search engine. Optimize for:

1. **Keywords in caption** - "How to use AI in real estate"
2. **Keywords in text overlay** - On-screen text matters
3. **Keywords spoken** - TikTok transcribes audio
4. **Hashtags** - Still matter for categorization

### Research Method

1. Go to TikTok search
2. Type your topic
3. Note autocomplete suggestions
4. Create content around those searches

---

## Trending Formats to Use

| Format | How to Adapt |
|--------|--------------|
| Green Screen | Show stats, screenshots, articles |
| Duet | React to bad AI advice |
| Stitch | Add to viral business content |
| POV | "POV: Your broker discovers AI" |
| Story Time | Real transformation stories |
| Day in the Life | Workshop day, consulting visits |

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **No hook** - Viewers scroll in 0.5 seconds
2. **Too polished** - Raw authenticity performs better
3. **Too long for the content** - Match length to value
4. **No captions** - Most watch muted
5. **Ignoring comments** - Reply within first hour
6. **Inconsistent posting** - Algorithm rewards daily content
7. **Not using trends** - Adapt trending sounds/formats
8. **Too salesy** - Value first, always

---

## Cross-Posting Strategy

- Post to TikTok FIRST (native content preferred)
- Remove TikTok watermark for Instagram Reels
- Repurpose vertical content to YouTube Shorts
- Same content, slight format adjustments
