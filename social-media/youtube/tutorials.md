### INTRO (0:00-0:45)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

What if I told you that you're probably wasting 14 hours every single week on tasks that AI could handle in minutes?

That's not a guess. That's the average across hundreds of real estate agents I've worked with.

Writing listing descriptions. Drafting follow-up emails. Creating social media content. Summarizing calls.

All of it can be systemized with AI.

In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how to set up a complete AI system for your real estate business. Not theory. Not "explore these tools." Actual setup you can use tomorrow.

My name is [Name], I train real estate brokerages on AI implementation, and by the end of this video, you'll have a working system.

Let's get into it.

---

### SECTION 1: The Foundation (0:45-4:00)

[SCREEN SHARE - ChatGPT]

Alright, first things first. You need an AI tool.

I recommend ChatGPT for beginners. It's free, it's good, and it's what most people start with. You can use Claude or Gemini too—they all work similarly.

Go to chat.openai.com. Create a free account.

Now, here's the first mistake everyone makes. They open ChatGPT and type something like... "write me a listing description."

[TYPE IT OUT]

And they get garbage back. Generic, robotic garbage that sounds like every other AI-generated listing.

Then they blame the tool.

The tool isn't the problem. Your instructions are the problem.

AI is like a really smart intern who has zero context about your business. If you give vague instructions, you get vague outputs.

So let's fix that.

---

### SECTION 2: Context Engineering (4:00-7:30)

[SCREEN SHARE]

The single most important skill in AI is context engineering. That's a fancy way of saying: give AI the information it needs to help you.

Here's the framework:

WHO are you? WHO is the AI pretending to be? WHAT do you need? HOW should it sound?

Let me show you.

Instead of "write me a listing description," try this:

[TYPE OUT FULL PROMPT]

"You are an experienced real estate copywriter who specializes in luxury properties. I'm a real estate agent in Nashville, Tennessee, selling a 4-bedroom home in the Green Hills neighborhood.

Here are the details:
- 4 bed, 3.5 bath, 3,200 sqft
- Renovated kitchen with Viking appliances
- Private backyard with heated pool
- Walking distance to Hillsboro Village

Write a compelling listing description that:
- Emphasizes lifestyle over features
- Uses sensory language
- Sounds confident but not salesy
- Is 150-200 words"

[SUBMIT AND SHOW RESULT]

Look at that difference. Same tool. Completely different output.

That's context engineering. You gave it a role, details, and guidelines.

---

### SECTION 3: Building Your Prompt Library (7:30-11:00)

[SCREEN SHARE - Google Doc or Notion]

Now, you don't want to type that context every single time. That defeats the purpose.

Instead, you build a prompt library.

Open a Google Doc. Or Notion. Or whatever you use.

Create sections for:
- Listing descriptions
- Follow-up emails
- Social media content
- Client communication
- Market updates

For each section, save your best prompts.

Let me give you a few to start with.

[TYPE AND EXPLAIN EACH]

**Listing Description Prompt:**

"You are a luxury real estate copywriter. Write a listing description for [ADDRESS].

Details: [PASTE MLS DATA]

Guidelines:
- Emphasize lifestyle, not just features
- Use sensory language
- Confident but not salesy
- 150-200 words"

**Follow-Up Email Prompt:**

"Write a follow-up email to a lead who:
- Attended an open house at [ADDRESS]
- Seemed interested but hasn't responded to my first email
- Is a first-time homebuyer

Tone: Helpful, not pushy. Offer value, not pressure.
Length: Under 100 words."

**Social Media Prompt:**

"Create 5 Instagram post ideas about [TOPIC] for a real estate agent.

For each post, provide:
- Hook (first line that stops the scroll)
- Main content (2-3 sentences)
- Call to action
- 3-5 relevant hashtags

Voice: Professional but approachable. Educational."

Save these. Edit them to match your voice. Build on them over time.

---

### SECTION 4: The Daily System (11:00-14:30)

[BACK TO CAMERA]

Okay, you've got the foundation. You've got prompts. Now let's talk about how to actually use this daily.

Here's my recommended AI routine for agents:

**Morning (15 minutes):**
- Check any AI-drafted follow-ups from yesterday
- Edit and send
- Review any content scheduled for today

**After Showings/Meetings (5 minutes each):**
- Voice memo summary while it's fresh
- Drop into AI for formal notes and action items

**Weekly Batch (1 hour):**
- Create all social content for the week
- Draft newsletters or market updates
- Set up follow-up sequences for new leads

That's it. Maybe 2-3 hours per week total. Versus the 14+ hours you're spending now.

The key is batching. Don't use AI one task at a time. Save similar tasks and knock them all out together.

---

### SECTION 5: Common Mistakes to Avoid (14:30-16:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Before we wrap up, let me save you some pain. Here are the mistakes I see constantly:

**Mistake 1: Copy-pasting without editing.**

AI gives you a first draft, not a final product. Always read it. Always add your voice. If it sounds robotic, edit it until it sounds like you.

**Mistake 2: No consistent voice guidelines.**

Every prompt should include how you want it to sound. Otherwise, you get generic AI voice that sounds like everyone else.

**Mistake 3: Trying to learn everything at once.**

Start with one use case. Get good at it. Then add another. Most people try to implement everything in a week and give up.

**Mistake 4: Not saving your best prompts.**

Every time you get a great output, save that prompt. Your library should grow over time.

**Mistake 5: Expecting perfection immediately.**

AI is a skill. Your first prompts will be worse than your hundredth. Keep practicing.

---

### SECTION 6: Next Steps (16:30-17:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

So here's your action plan:

Step 1: Create a ChatGPT account if you haven't.

Step 2: Start a prompt library document.

Step 3: Copy the prompts I showed you today.

Step 4: Use them on ONE real task this week.

Step 5: Save what works. Iterate on what doesn't.

That's it. That's how you start.

If you want to go deeper—if you want hands-on training with a complete prompt library and systems you can use immediately—I run workshops for brokerages. Link is in the description.

But honestly? You have everything you need to start right now. In this video. For free.

## Tutorial 2: The AI Follow-Up System That Actually Works

**Length:** 16 minutes
**Target:** Agents struggling with consistent follow-up
**Title:** "Never Lose Another Lead: The AI Follow-Up System for Real Estate"
**Thumbnail:** Two phones - one with "Lost Lead" crossed out, one with "Closed Deal"

---

### INTRO (0:00-0:40)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Here's a stat that should keep you up at night:

The average real estate agent follows up with a lead once. Maybe twice. Then they forget.

Meanwhile, research shows it takes 8-12 touches to convert a lead into a client.

You're not losing deals because of skill. You're losing them because of follow-up.

In this video, I'm going to show you how to build an AI follow-up system that ensures no lead ever falls through the cracks again.

Let's do it.

---

### SECTION 1: The Follow-Up Problem (0:40-2:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Let me paint a picture. Sound familiar?

Lead comes in from Zillow. You call them immediately—good job. They're interested but not ready.

You say "I'll follow up next week."

Next week comes. You're busy with a closing. You forget.

Three weeks later, you remember. But now it's awkward. You reach out anyway. No response.

That lead is gone. They probably found another agent who actually followed up.

This happens dozens of times per year for most agents. Dozens of deals lost.

Not because you're bad at your job. Because follow-up is hard when it's manual.

It requires memory. Organization. Consistency. And you've got a hundred other things competing for attention.

AI doesn't forget. AI doesn't get busy. AI doesn't feel awkward about the timing.

Let's build a system.

---

### SECTION 2: The Sequence Framework (2:30-6:00)

[SCREEN SHARE]

Here's the framework I teach:

Every new lead gets a 6-touch sequence. Not one email. Not two. Six touches over 30 days.

**Day 1: Initial response**
Personal, specific to how they found you.

**Day 3: Value add**
Something helpful—neighborhood guide, market stats, article.

**Day 7: Soft check-in**
"Just wanted to see if you had any questions."

**Day 14: Social proof**
Share a recent success story.

**Day 21: Direct ask**
"Would you like to schedule a call?"

**Day 30: Long-term nurture**
"I'll keep you in the loop on the market. No pressure."

That's the framework. Now let's use AI to write all six emails.

[OPEN CHATGPT]

Here's the master prompt:

"You are a real estate follow-up specialist. Create a 6-email sequence for a new lead.

Lead info:
- Name: [NAME]
- Source: [WHERE THEY FOUND YOU]
- Interest: [BUYING/SELLING, AREA, PRICE RANGE]

Sequence:
- Email 1 (Day 1): Personal response acknowledging how they found you
- Email 2 (Day 3): Value add with helpful resource
- Email 3 (Day 7): Soft check-in
- Email 4 (Day 14): Social proof / recent success story
- Email 5 (Day 21): Direct ask for call
- Email 6 (Day 30): Long-term nurture, remove pressure

Tone: Helpful and professional, not pushy. Each email under 100 words."

[SUBMIT AND SHOW RESULTS]

Six emails. Maybe 30 seconds of AI time. Now you just personalize and schedule.

---

### SECTION 3: Personalization That Scales (6:00-9:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Now, here's the thing. AI-written emails only work if they don't SOUND AI-written.

If every lead gets the exact same sequence, they'll feel it. It'll feel mass-produced. Impersonal.

So you need to add personalization layers.

Layer 1: Lead source personalization.

Someone from Zillow gets different email 1 than someone from a referral. The AI prompt includes their source, and the output adapts.

[SHOW EXAMPLE]

Layer 2: Specific detail injection.

In every email, there should be ONE specific detail about them. Something from your conversation. Something from their inquiry.

"You mentioned you loved the kitchen at the Maple Street showing..."

That one line makes the whole email feel personal.

Layer 3: Voice matching.

Give AI examples of your actual emails. Say "match this tone and style."

[SHOW EXAMPLE]

Now you've got emails that scale but still feel human.

---

### SECTION 4: The CRM Integration (9:30-12:30)

[SCREEN SHARE]

Okay, you've got the emails. But where do they live? How do you track them?

If you're using a CRM—Follow Up Boss, kvCORE, whatever—you can input these sequences directly.

But even if you're not, you can build a simple system.

[SHOW GOOGLE SHEET]

Here's a basic tracker:

Columns:
- Lead name
- Source
- Date added
- Email 1 sent (date)
- Email 2 sent (date)
- ...
- Email 6 sent (date)
- Status (Active/Converted/Cold)

Every Monday, you spend 15 minutes looking at this sheet.

Who needs their next email?
Who hasn't responded in 30+ days?
Who converted?

This takes follow-up from "when I remember" to "systematic and guaranteed."

---

### SECTION 5: The Reactivation Campaign (12:30-14:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Now let's talk about the leads you've ALREADY lost.

You know those hundreds of contacts sitting in your CRM or phone who you haven't talked to in months? Maybe years?

They're not dead. They're just dormant.

Here's how to wake them up with AI:

[SCREEN SHARE]

"Write a reactivation email for a real estate lead I haven't contacted in 6+ months.

Context: They were interested in [BUYING/SELLING] in [AREA] but we lost touch.

Approach: Acknowledge the gap without apologizing excessively. Provide value (market update or relevant news). Low-pressure invitation to reconnect.

Tone: Warm, not desperate. Under 75 words."

[SUBMIT AND SHOW]

I've seen agents send this type of email to 100 dormant leads and get 15-20 responses.

That's leads you'd written off. Coming back to life.

---

### SECTION 6: Implementation Plan (14:30-15:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Here's your action plan:

This week:
1. Build your 6-email sequence using the prompts I showed you
2. Identify your 10 most recent leads who need follow-up
3. Send email 1 to all of them (personalized)
4. Schedule the rest

Next week:
1. Pull your "dormant" list (6+ months, no contact)
2. Send reactivation emails to 50 of them
3. Track responses

That's it. Two hours of work. Potentially thousands of dollars in recovered business.

---

### OUTRO (15:30-16:00)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Follow-up is where deals are won and lost. The agents who follow up consistently close more deals. Period.

AI makes consistency possible for everyone, not just the super-organized few.

## Tutorial 3: Content Creation in 30 Minutes: The AI Batch Method

**Length:** 15 minutes
**Target:** Agents spending hours on social media
**Title:** "I Create 30 Days of Content in 30 Minutes (Real Estate AI Method)"
**Thumbnail:** Calendar with checkmarks, clock showing 30 minutes

---

### INTRO (0:00-0:35)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

How long do you spend creating social media content every week?

If you're like most agents, it's 3-5 hours. Maybe more.

What if you could do a whole month in 30 minutes?

That's not an exaggeration. That's the batch method.

In this video, I'm going to show you the exact system I use to create 30 days of content in one sitting. Real estate specific. AI-powered. Actually good.

Let's go.

---

### SECTION 1: The Problem with Daily Content (0:35-2:00)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Here's why most agents fail at content:

They try to create it daily. They sit down Monday and think "what should I post?" They stare at their phone. Nothing comes. They post something generic or skip the day.

This is the worst possible approach.

Content creation requires a different mental mode than client work. You can't switch into it for 10 minutes, create something great, then switch back to showings.

That's why batching works.

You carve out one focused block—30 to 60 minutes—and create everything at once. Then you schedule it and forget about it.

No more daily pressure. No more "what do I post?" anxiety.

---

### SECTION 2: The Content Framework (2:00-4:30)

[SCREEN SHARE]

Before we create, we need a framework.

I use a simple content mix:

40% Educational - Tips, how-tos, market insights
30% Personal/Story - Behind the scenes, client stories, your journey
20% Engagement - Questions, polls, conversation starters
10% Promotional - Your services, listings, workshops

For 30 days of content (one post per day), that's:
- 12 educational posts
- 9 personal/story posts
- 6 engagement posts
- 3 promotional posts

Now let's create them all.

---

### SECTION 3: The Batch Creation Process (4:30-10:00)

[SCREEN SHARE - ChatGPT]

Here's the master prompt:

"You are a social media strategist for real estate professionals. Create a 30-day content calendar for a real estate agent.

Content mix:
- 12 educational posts (tips, market insights, how-tos)
- 9 personal/story posts (behind the scenes, journey, lessons learned)
- 6 engagement posts (questions, polls, conversation starters)
- 3 promotional posts (services, listings, call to action)

For each post, provide:
- Hook (first line that stops the scroll)
- Body (3-5 sentences)
- Call to action
- 3-5 hashtags

Voice: Professional but approachable. Educational without being boring. Conversational.

Market: [YOUR CITY/AREA]
Niche: [YOUR SPECIALTY IF ANY]"

[SUBMIT AND WAIT]

[SHOW RESULTS]

Look at that. 30 posts. Ready to edit.

Now, you don't just copy and paste. You go through each one:

[EDIT ONE LIVE]

- Does this sound like me?
- Is there a personal detail I can add?
- Is the hook actually good?
- Does the CTA make sense?

Spend 30-60 seconds per post. That's 15-30 minutes for the whole month.

---

### SECTION 4: Platform Adaptation (10:00-12:00)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Now, different platforms need different formats.

Instagram wants visual-first content with shorter captions.
LinkedIn wants more professional, longer-form posts.
Facebook wants conversation-starters.
TikTok wants video hooks.

You can use AI to adapt.

[SCREEN SHARE]

Take any post from your batch. Say:

"Rewrite this post for Instagram. Shorter caption, more casual, stronger hook, add emoji strategically."

Or:

"Turn this into a LinkedIn post. More professional tone, add a contrarian insight, include a question at the end."

Same content. Different platforms. Five minutes of work.

---

### SECTION 5: Scheduling and Automation (12:00-13:30)

[SCREEN SHARE]

Once you've got your content, you need to schedule it.

Free options: Meta Business Suite (Facebook/Instagram), TikTok's native scheduler
Paid options: Later, Hootsuite, Buffer, Sprout

Pick one. Upload your month of content. Set the times.

[SHOW SCHEDULING INTERFACE]

Now you're done. Content handled for 30 days.

Your competition is spending 4 hours per week stressed about what to post.

You spent 30 minutes once and moved on.

---

### SECTION 6: The Repurposing Loop (13:30-14:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

One more thing: repurposing.

Your best-performing content should get recycled.

Every month, look at what performed best. Take those posts and:

- Turn written posts into video scripts
- Expand short posts into long-form content
- Break long posts into carousel slides
- Repost high performers 60-90 days later

Content isn't one-and-done. It's a loop.

The agents posting daily aren't creating 365 pieces of content per year. They're creating maybe 50 and repurposing strategically.

---

### OUTRO (14:30-15:00)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

That's the batch method. 30 minutes for 30 days of content.

Try it this week. Set aside one hour. Create your first batch.

I promise you'll never go back to daily creation.

Subscribe for more AI real estate content. Drop a comment with your favorite content topic—I'll include it in a future video.

See you next time.

## Tutorial 4: The AI Masterclass Preview: What Top Brokerages Are Doing Differently

**Length:** 20 minutes
**Target:** Broker-owners considering training
**Title:** "Inside an AI Masterclass: How We Train Top Real Estate Brokerages"
**Thumbnail:** Workshop room with agents at laptops, "INSIDE" text

---

### INTRO (0:00-0:50)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

I've trained over 50 real estate brokerages on AI in the last year.

Teams of 5 agents. Teams of 200 agents. Association groups. Luxury brokerages. Commercial brokerages.

And I've noticed something interesting.

The brokerages that get real results from AI—not just adoption, but actual ROI—they do things differently.

Today I'm going to share what those things are. Consider this a preview of what we cover in our 6-hour AI Masterclass.

Whether you end up working with us or not, you'll leave this video with actionable insights you can implement in your brokerage.

Let's dive in.

---

### SECTION 1: The Implementation Gap (0:50-4:00)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Let's start with the problem.

68% of brokerages say they're "using AI." But only 17% report measurable results.

That's a 51-point implementation gap.

What's causing it?

After working with hundreds of agents, I've identified three main culprits.

**Problem 1: Individual adoption vs. team implementation.**

Most brokerages have a few early adopters who figure it out on their own. Everyone else watches and waits.

The result? Inconsistent quality. No shared systems. Knowledge silos.

**Problem 2: Demo-style training.**

Someone shows the team that ChatGPT exists. Maybe demonstrates a few prompts. Everyone nods. Nothing changes.

That's a demo, not training.

**Problem 3: No follow-through infrastructure.**

Even when agents get trained, there's no ongoing support. No way to share what's working. No accountability.

Skills fade. Habits don't form. Adoption stalls.

The brokerages seeing real results solve all three problems.

---

### SECTION 2: The Team-First Approach (4:00-7:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Here's the first thing top brokerages do differently: they train as a team.

Not "here's a login, figure it out." Not "watch this YouTube video."

Same room. Same day. Same experience.

Why does this matter?

First, shared language. When everyone goes through training together, they develop common terminology. "Did you try the listing prompt?" "Use the follow-up sequence." They can help each other because they have the same foundation.

Second, accountability. It's harder to skip implementation when your whole team is doing it together. Peer pressure works.

Third, compounding knowledge. When one agent finds a better prompt, they share it with the team. The library improves for everyone. That only happens if everyone starts with the same library.

[SHOW EXAMPLE PROMPT LIBRARY]

This is what a shared prompt library looks like. Every agent has access. Every agent can contribute. The library grows over time.

Six months after training, one brokerage I worked with had over 200 tested prompts in their shared library. That's institutional knowledge that stays even when agents leave.

---

### SECTION 3: Hands-On Implementation (7:30-11:00)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

The second thing top brokerages do: hands-on implementation during training.

Our 6-hour masterclass isn't 6 hours of watching me talk.

Here's the actual structure:

**Hour 1: Foundation**
- Why most AI adoption fails
- The context engineering framework
- Your first successful prompt

**Hours 2-3: Core Systems**
- Listing descriptions that actually convert
- Follow-up sequences that feel personal
- Content creation batch method
- Meeting and admin automation

**Hour 4: Hands-On Practice**
- Everyone works on THEIR listings
- THEIR follow-ups
- THEIR content

**Hour 5: Team System Building**
- Creating your shared prompt library
- Establishing quality standards
- Setting up ongoing improvement process

**Hour 6: Advanced Techniques + Q&A**
- Prompt chaining
- Voice cloning
- Integration with existing tools
- Open Q&A

By hour 4, every agent has used AI on their actual work. Not hypotheticals. Their real listings, their real leads.

That's the difference between "that was interesting" and "I'm using this tomorrow."

---

### SECTION 4: The ROI Reality (11:00-14:00)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Let's talk numbers. Because ultimately, this has to make business sense.

Here's the math we walk through with every brokerage:

**Time Savings:**
Average agent saves 14 hours/week with proper AI implementation.

That's not a guess—it's aggregated data from our trained teams.

**Dollar Value:**
14 hours × $50/hour productive value = $700/week per agent
$700 × 52 weeks = $36,400/year per agent

For a 10-agent team: $364,000 in recovered productivity annually.

**Training Investment:**
Our masterclass is $5,000 for up to 20 agents.
That's $250 per agent.

**Break-Even:**
At $700/week savings, you break even in about 3 days.

After that, it's pure return.

Now, not every agent will save exactly 14 hours. Some save more, some less. But even at half that—7 hours—the math works overwhelmingly.

This isn't a nice-to-have expense. It's an investment with measurable, trackable ROI.

---

### SECTION 5: What We Don't Do (14:00-16:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Let me be clear about what this training isn't.

**We don't teach theory.**

If you want theory, there are a thousand YouTube videos. We teach implementation. Prompts you'll use that day.

**We don't promise magic.**

AI is a tool. A powerful tool, but still a tool. It requires practice. It requires refinement. Anyone promising "10x your business overnight" is selling you something.

**We don't replace human skill.**

The best AI-equipped agents are still great at relationships, negotiation, and market knowledge. AI handles the repetitive work so they can focus on the human work.

**We don't do one-size-fits-all.**

Every brokerage is different. Luxury vs. residential. High volume vs. boutique. We customize examples and prompts to your actual business.

If you're looking for a magic pill, this isn't it.

If you're looking for systematic implementation that creates measurable results, let's talk.

---

### SECTION 6: Is This Right For You? (16:30-18:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

Here's who should consider this training:

**Broker-owners** who are tired of watching agents waste time on repetitive tasks.

**Managing brokers** who want consistent systems across their team.

**Association directors** looking to provide real value to member brokerages.

**Teams ready to implement**, not just learn. If you want to watch a presentation and take no action, this isn't for you.

Here's who shouldn't:

**Individual agents** not connected to a team. We can do one-on-one coaching, but the masterclass is designed for teams.

**People looking for shortcuts.** AI is powerful, but it's not magic.

**Brokerages not willing to invest 6 hours.** If you can't commit one day, you're not serious about implementation.

---

### SECTION 7: Next Steps (18:30-19:30)

[DIRECT TO CAMERA]

If you're interested in bringing this to your brokerage, here's the process:

Step 1: Reach out. Link in the description or DM me on any platform.

Step 2: We'll do a 20-minute call to understand your team, your challenges, and your goals.

Step 3: If it's a fit, we'll schedule your masterclass.

We work with brokerages across Tennessee, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia. If you're outside that area, we can discuss options.

No hard sell. No pressure. If it's not a fit, I'll tell you.

But if your team is ready to stop wasting time on tasks AI could handle, let's make it happen.
