## The Strategy: Data Beats Decoration

**What doesn't work:** Generic lifestyle photos of "confident brokers at desks"
**What works:** Data visualizations, infographics, and statistics that stop the scroll

Based on [research from top creators](https://blog.google/technology/ai/nano-banana-pro/), LinkedIn posts with data-driven visuals get 57% more impressions than generic stock imagery.

### The Formula
1. **Hook with a stat** - 68% vs 17%, 14 hours wasted, $6,000/year value
2. **Visualize the gap** - Before/after bars, comparison charts, process flows
3. **Add text in Canva** - Never trust AI for exact numbers
4. **Match brand colors** - Crimson Red (#C41E3A), Champagne Gold (#D4AF37), Sky Blue (#87CEEB), White (#FFFFFF)

---

## Quick Start

1. Pick a platform folder
2. Read the README for that platform's best practices
3. Copy/paste posts directly - they're ready to go
4. Generate data graphics using `nanobanana/prompts.md` (run Style Guide first!)
5. Add exact text/numbers in Canva
6. See `cross-platform-strategy.md` for reusing assets across platforms
7. Store all visuals in `assets/` using the naming convention

## NanoBanana Workflow (Critical!)

**DO NOT skip these steps or you'll get generic garbage:**

1. **Run Style Guide First** - See `nanobanana/prompts.md` Step 0
2. **Pick a Data Point** - 68% vs 17%, 14 hours, $6,000, etc.
3. **Choose Visual Type** - Metric bomb, bar chart, process flow
4. **Generate in NanoBanana** - Use the specific prompts
5. **Add Text in Canva** - Never trust AI for exact numbers
6. **Export at Right Size** - LinkedIn: 1200x1560, IG: 1080x1350

**Common Mistakes:**
- Skipping the style guide → inconsistent look
- Trusting AI for text → typos and wrong numbers
- Generic prompts → stock photo vibes
- Wrong aspect ratio → cropped/stretched graphics

---

## Brand Voice

**Tone:** Direct, no-BS, data-driven, consultant (not salesperson)

**Reading Level:** 5th grade - simple words, short sentences

**Core Message:** "Implementation, not webinars"

**The New Paradigm:** Speed + Human Connection
- AI handles the speed (admin, content, follow-ups)
- Agents handle the connection (relationships, trust, showing up)
- We make agents MORE human, not less

---

## Key Statistics (Use These)

| Stat | Number | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Agents who adopted AI | 68% | NAR 2025 - verified |
| Agents seeing real results | 17% | NAR 2025 - verified |
| The gap (our opportunity) | 51% | Calculated - verified |
| Hours on admin per agent/week | 10+ | Industry studies - verified |
| Listing description time saved | 30 min → 5 min | Industry benchmarks - verified |
| Social media time saved | 3+ hrs/week | Estimated |
| Follow-up email time saved | 3+ hrs/week | Estimated |

## Value Messaging (Use Conditional Framing)

**DON'T claim specific ROI numbers.** Instead use conditional framing:
- "If training helps each agent close ONE extra deal, it pays for itself"
- "If agents generate just $500 more, the course paid for itself"

**Beta Pricing:** $5,000 (Beta pricing - ~~4~~ 3 classes left)
