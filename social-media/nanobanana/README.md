# Production-Ready Graphics for AI Acceleration Workshop

**These are NOT templates. These are finished, post-ready content.**

Every prompt in this folder generates a complete graphic for the AI Acceleration Workshop - our $5,000 6-Hour Masterclass for real estate brokerages.

## THE RULE: NO TEMPLATES

If a prompt contains ANY of these, it's garbage and needs to be rewritten:
- "Text zone for..."
- "Placeholder"
- "Add in Canva"
- "Space for numbers"
- Generic language without our product/stats

**Every prompt must include:**
1. **Actual text** - The exact words that appear on the graphic
2. **Our stats** - 68%, 17%, 10+ hours, 30 min → 5 min (all verified)
3. **Value framing** - "If training helps close ONE extra deal, it pays for itself" (conditional, not claims)
4. **Pricing** - $5,000 (Beta pricing - ~~4~~ 3 classes left)
5. **Our audience** - Real estate brokerages, broker-owners, agents
6. **Visual spec** - Size, colors, style

## Our Stats (Memorize These)

### The AI Paradox
- **68%** of agents adopted AI tools
- **17%** see actual results
- **51%** are doing it wrong (our opportunity)

### Time Savings Per Agent Per Week
| Task | Before | After | Saved |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| Listing descriptions | 30 min | 5 min | 25 min × 4 = 1.5 hrs |
| Social media | 60 min/day | 20 min/day | 3+ hrs/week |
| Follow-up emails | 60 min/day | 20 min/day | 3+ hrs/week |
| Lead qualification | 45 min/day | 15 min/day | 2.5 hrs/week |
| **TOTAL** | | | **10+ hrs/week** |

### Value Framing (Conditional - NOT Claims)
Instead of claiming specific ROI, use conditional framing:
- "If training helps each agent close ONE extra deal, the investment pays for itself"
- "If agents generate just $500 more, the course paid for itself"

**DO NOT claim:** "$500/month value", "12:1 ROI", "$6,000/year per agent"
**DO say:** "If X happens, Y pays for itself" (conditional, honest)

## Example: Good vs Bad Prompt

### BAD (lazy template garbage):
```
Design a data visualization showing two percentages.
Large number zone. Leave space for text to add later.
Include placeholder areas for supporting stats.
```

### GOOD (production-ready):
```
Create an infographic titled "The AI Paradox in Real Estate"

MAIN VISUAL:
Two massive numbers side by side on dark red (#2D0A0A) background
- Left: "68%" in gray with text below: "of agents adopted AI"
- Right: "17%" in champagne gold (#D4AF37) with text below: "see actual results"

Between them, a visual gap showing "51%" with text: "are doing it wrong"

BOTTOM SECTION:
"Training closes the gap."
"AI Acceleration Workshop | 6 Hours | $5,000"
"Hands-on. Not webinars."

Style: Dashboard UI aesthetic. The 17% should glow champagne gold to emphasize
the opportunity. High contrast for mobile. 1:1 square format.
```

## Workflow

1. Pick a prompt from `prompts.md`
2. Copy the ENTIRE prompt (it has all the text baked in)
3. Paste into NanoBanana/Gemini
4. Generate
5. If it looks generic, regenerate or refine
6. Save to `assets/` with proper naming

**If you have to add text in Canva, the prompt was bad. Go back and fix it.**

## The New Real Estate Paradigm

**Speed + Human Connection**

The winners in real estate aren't choosing between technology and relationships - they're using AI to be MORE human:
- **AI handles speed:** Admin, content, follow-ups, listing descriptions
- **Agents handle connection:** Relationships, negotiations, trust, showing up

Our training makes agents faster at the robot work so they can spend more time on the human work.

## What We're Selling (Never Forget)

We're not selling "AI training" - everyone has that.

We're selling:
- **10+ hours/week back** for every agent
- **One extra deal per agent** = training pays for itself
- **Working systems built in one day** (not theory)
- **Work-life balance** (home by 5pm, not 9pm)
- **Competitive advantage** (68% have tools, only 17% use them well)
- **Beta pricing** - $5,000 for first ~~4~~ 3 classes only

Every graphic should make a broker-owner think: "If this helps my agents close one extra deal, it's worth it."
