## Value Messaging (Conditional Framing - NOT Claims)

We do NOT claim specific dollar values. Instead, we use conditional framing:

### What NOT to Say vs What TO Say
| DON'T USE | USE INSTEAD |
|-----------|-------------|
| "$500/month value per agent" | "If training helps agents generate $500 more, it pays for itself" |
| "$6,000/year per agent" | Don't use - too specific |
| "12:1 ROI" | "If time savings translate to deals, the ROI is significant" |
| "Payback in 30 days" | "Quick payback potential" |

### The Key Principle
We're not claiming value. We're saying: **"IF this works, THEN it pays for itself."**

This is honest, defensible, and actually more persuasive than specific claims.

### Beta Pricing
- **$5,000** is our beta price for the first limited classes
- Use: "$5,000 (Beta pricing - ~~4~~ 3 classes left)"
- This creates urgency and is TRUE - we are in beta

### Workshop Metrics (FUTURE - Track After Real Workshops)
| Metric | Value | Basis |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Participants who create usable content | [TRACK] | Workshop completion data |
| Participants who implement within 30 days | [TRACK] | 30-day follow-up surveys |
| Time savings reported | [TRACK] | Post-workshop feedback |

**Important:** DO NOT claim workshop results until you have conducted actual workshops and collected real data. Track these metrics from your first workshop onwards.

## Stats We Do NOT Use (Liability Risk)

| Topic | Why Avoided |
|-------|-------------|
| Wire fraud statistics | Legal liability - not our area of expertise |
| Fraud prevention guarantees | Liability if an incident occurs after training |
| Compliance guarantees | Legal exposure for outcomes we can't control |
| Fair Housing claims | Legal liability for compliance outcomes |
| Hiring/retention promises | HR liability |
| Specific response rate improvements | No verifiable source |
