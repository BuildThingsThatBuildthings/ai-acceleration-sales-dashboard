## Quick Tips Reels (12 scripts) - 15-30 seconds

### Reel 1: The Ferrari Analogy
```
HOOK: "Your agents are using AI like a Ferrari to go to the mailbox."

SCRIPT:
[Look at camera]
"68% of agents say they use AI.

But only 17% see real results.

Why?

They type 'write a listing description.'
Four words.
That's it.

That's like buying a Ferrari...
and only driving it to the mailbox.

The tool isn't broken.
The training is missing."

[Point at camera]
"Comment TRAIN if you want to fix this."

---
CAPTION:
The AI Paradox: 68% of agents adopted AI. Only 17% see results.

The difference? Training. Not the tool.

Comment "TRAIN" and I'll share exactly how we fix this.

```

### Reel 2: 14 Hours
```
HOOK: "Your agents waste 14 hours every week."

SCRIPT:
[Look at camera, slightly frustrated expression]
"I did the math with 50 brokerages.

Listing descriptions? 2 hours.
AI does it in 10 minutes.

Social media? 3 hours.
AI does it in 15 minutes.

Follow-up emails? 4 hours.
AI does it in 20 minutes.

That's 14 hours back.
Per agent.
Per week.

20 agents?
280 hours you're losing.
Every. Single. Week."

[Point at camera]
"Free assessment in bio."

---
CAPTION:
14 hours × 20 agents × 52 weeks = 14,560 wasted hours per year.

That's 7 full-time employees worth of productivity.

### Reel 3: The 17%
```
HOOK: "The 17% who actually get results from AI do this:"

SCRIPT:
[Count on fingers]
"One: They train the whole team.
Not one person playing around.
Everyone. Together.

Two: They build systems.
Not random experiments.
Workflows that repeat.

Three: They measure.
Time saved. Deals closed.
Real numbers.

The other 83%?
Download ChatGPT.
Try it once.
Get garbage.
Give up."

[Shrug]
"Which group is your team in?"

---
CAPTION:
The difference between the 17% winning with AI and everyone else isn't talent.

It's training.

Comment which group you're in. Be honest.

### Reel 4: The Prompt Fix
```
HOOK: "Stop typing 'write a listing description.'"

SCRIPT:
[Show phone/laptop screen]
"Bad prompt: 'Write a listing description.'

Good prompt:

'You are a luxury real estate copywriter.
Write a listing description for this 4-bed home.
Highlight the chef's kitchen and primary suite.
Make it emotional and lifestyle-focused.
150 words max.'

Same tool.
Completely different results.

Context is the skill.
And it takes 6 hours to learn."

[Look at camera]
"DM PROMPTS for 47 more like this."

---
CAPTION:
The difference between garbage AI output and gold?

Context.

DM me "PROMPTS" and I'll send you 47 prompts that actually work for real estate.

### Reel 5: While You Sleep
```
HOOK: "While you sleep, AI can do this:"

SCRIPT:
[List on screen as you speak]
"Respond to every lead inquiry.
Schedule showing confirmations.
Send follow-up emails.
Post your social content.
Update your CRM.
Generate market reports.

All while you're sleeping.

Your competitors figured this out.
That's why they look rested.
That's why they're closing more.
That's why they're winning."

"Want the system? Link in bio."

### Reel 6: 3 Questions
```
HOOK: "3 questions that expose your AI problem:"

SCRIPT:
[Hold up fingers]
"One: How long does a listing description take your agents?
If it's more than 15 minutes, problem.

Two: When was your last social post?
If you have to think about it, problem.

Three: How many leads got follow-up this week?
If you don't know the number, problem.

AI solves all three.
But only if you implement it right."

[Tilt head]
"Which question exposed you?"

---
CAPTION:
Be honest. Which question got you?

Comment 1, 2, or 3.

### Reel 7: The Math
```
HOOK: "The math that should scare every broker:"

SCRIPT:
[Write numbers on screen or whiteboard]
"Agent hourly value: $50
Hours wasted per week: 14
Weekly loss per agent: $700

Multiply by 10 agents:
$7,000 per week.
$28,000 per month.
$336,000 per year.

That's not a budget line.
That's a leak.
And it's fixable."

[Look at camera seriously]
"Stop the bleeding. Link in bio."

---
CAPTION:
$336,000 per year in lost productivity. For a 10-agent brokerage.

### Reel 8: Same Office, Different Results
```
HOOK: "Same office. Two types of agents."

SCRIPT:
[Split screen concept - act out both]
"Agent A:
Works until midnight.
Does everything manually.
Always behind.
Burned out.

Agent B:
Leaves at 5.
Uses AI for routine tasks.
Marketing on autopilot.
Energized.

Same market.
Same opportunity.
Same tools available.

Different choice."

[Serious look]
"Which one are you training?"

---
CAPTION:
The difference isn't talent. It's training.

Which type fills your office?

```

### Reel 9: Stop This
```
HOOK: "Stop saying 'AI doesn't work for real estate.'"

SCRIPT:
[Dismissive hand wave]
"I hear this every week.

'We tried AI. Didn't work.'

What they mean:
One person.
Downloaded ChatGPT.
Typed something vague.
Got vague output.
Gave up.

That's not AI failing.
That's implementation failing.

AI absolutely works for real estate.
But not by accident."

[Point at camera]
"Intentional implementation. That's the difference."

---
CAPTION:
AI works. Bad implementation doesn't.

The tool is fine. The approach is broken.

Comment if you've "tried AI" and given up.

```

### Reel 10: One Day
```
HOOK: "One day of training. A year of results."

SCRIPT:
[Calendar visual or gesture]
"Day 1: Learn the tools.
Day 2: First workflows running.
Week 1: Time savings obvious.
Month 1: ROI positive.
Month 3: Can't imagine going back.
Year 1: 15 hours/week per agent saved.

One day.
6 hours.
That's the investment.

Everything after?
Returns."

[Confident nod]
"Worth one day?"

---
CAPTION:
6 hours to learn. 780 hours saved per agent per year.

That's the math.

### Reel 11: The Competitor Fear
```
HOOK: "Your competitor just figured this out."

SCRIPT:
[Concerned expression]
"Right now, somewhere in your market:

A brokerage trained their team on AI.
Their listings go up faster.
Their content posts automatically.
Their leads get instant response.
Their agents leave at 5.

And they're not waiting for you to catch up.

Every week you wait...
They get further ahead.

The gap doesn't close.
It widens."

[Urgent tone]
"Link in bio. Don't wait."

---
CAPTION:
The brokerages who move first build advantages that compound.

By the time you "find time" to figure this out... they're 6 months ahead.

### Reel 12: Not Replacing
```
HOOK: "AI won't replace real estate agents."

SCRIPT:
[Calm, reassuring tone]
"AI won't replace agents.

AI can't build trust at a kitchen table.
AI can't negotiate a tough seller down.
AI can't hold a first-time buyer's hand.

But AI CAN:
Write your marketing.
Handle your follow-ups.
Analyze your data.
Schedule your content.

AI won't replace agents.
But agents using AI...
Will replace agents who don't."

[Knowing look]
"Which side do you want to be on?"

---
CAPTION:
AI isn't the threat. Ignoring it is.

The agents who embrace it will outperform those who don't.

Which side are you choosing?
