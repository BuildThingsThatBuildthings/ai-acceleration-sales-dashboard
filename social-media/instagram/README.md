## Reels Best Practices

### The Hook (First 3 Seconds)

This is make-or-break. Options:

1. **Bold Statement:** "Your agents waste 14 hours every week."
2. **Question:** "Why do 83% of brokers fail with AI?"
3. **Pattern Interrupt:** Start mid-action or mid-sentence
4. **Promise:** "I'm about to save you 3 hours."

### Optimal Length

| Length | Best For | Algorithm Impact |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| 7-15 sec | Quick tips, hooks | Good for testing |
| 30-60 sec | Tutorials, stories | Sweet spot |
| 60-90 sec | Deep dives | Max recommended |
| 90+ sec | Special content | Reduced reach for new audiences |

### Technical Requirements

- **Aspect Ratio:** 9:16 vertical
- **Resolution:** 1080x1920 minimum
- **Captions:** Always add (80% watch muted)
- **No TikTok watermarks** (algorithm buries them)
- **Native audio or trending sounds**

### Structure Template

```
0:00-0:03 - HOOK (stop the scroll)
0:03-0:07 - CONTEXT (why this matters)
0:07-0:25 - VALUE (the actual content)
0:25-0:30 - CTA (what to do next)
```

---

## Carousel Best Practices

### Why Carousels Work

- **2x more saves** than Reels
- If first slide doesn't engage, Instagram shows the second slide
- Each swipe = engagement signal
- Longer time on post = algorithm boost

### Slide Structure

**Slide 1:** Hook - must stop the scroll
**Slide 2:** Equally compelling (second chance from algorithm)
**Slides 3-8:** Value delivery
**Slide 9-10:** CTA and summary

### Design Tips

- **Consistent branding** across all slides
- **Large, readable text** (mobile-first)
- **One idea per slide**
- **Progress indicators** (1/10, 2/10, etc.)
- **Swipe prompts** on first slides

### Optimal Carousel Length

| Slides | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| 5-7 | Quick tips, lists |
| 8-10 | In-depth guides |
| 10 (max) | Comprehensive content |

---

## Hashtag Strategy

### Current Best Practice

- **3-5 hashtags** (not 30)
- Mix of sizes:
  - 1-2 large (1M+ posts)
  - 2-3 medium (100K-1M posts)
  - 1-2 niche (under 100K posts)

### Recommended Hashtags

**Large:**
- #realestate
- #realtor
- #realestateinvesting

**Medium:**
- #realestatetips
- #realestateagent
- #realestatemarketing

**Niche:**
- #realestatebrokerage
- #brokerlife
- #realestateai
- #aitraining

### Placement

Put hashtags in the caption, not comments (2025 update).

---

## Posting Schedule

**Frequency:** 1-2 posts per day (feed + stories)

**Best Times:**
- 11 AM - 1 PM (lunch break)
- 7 PM - 9 PM (evening scroll)

**Consistency:** 2-3 Reels per week minimum

---

## Caption Structure

### For Reels

```
[HOOK - First line that appears before "more"]

[2-3 sentences expanding on the content]

[CTA - What you want them to do]

[Hashtags]
```

### For Carousels

```
[HOOK - Matches slide 1]

[Context - Why this matters]

[Summary of what's inside - creates desire to swipe]

[CTA]

[Hashtags]
```

---

## CTA Options

**Soft:**
- "Double tap if this resonates"
- "Save this for later"
- "Tag a broker who needs this"

**Medium:**
- "Comment [WORD] for the guide"
- "DM me [WORD] for details"
- "Link in bio for more"

**Hard:**
- "12 spots left - link in bio"
- "DM me 'WORKSHOP' to reserve"

---

## Stories Strategy

Use Stories to:
- Drive engagement on feed posts
- Share behind-the-scenes content
- Run polls and questions
- Direct traffic to link in bio

**Post 3-7 Stories per day** during active campaigns.

---

## Highlights Structure

Create Highlights for:
- **Results** - Testimonials and case studies
- **Tips** - Best educational content
- **Workshop** - Info about your offering
- **About** - Who you are and what you do

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Weak hooks** - First 3 seconds are everything
2. **TikTok watermarks** - Repost natively
3. **Too many hashtags** - 3-5 max
4. **No captions** - 80% watch muted
5. **Inconsistent posting** - Algorithm rewards consistency
6. **Ignoring carousel power** - They outperform for engagement
