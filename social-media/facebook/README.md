## Algorithm Insights (2025)

### Key Ranking Signals

| Signal | Weight | How to Win |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Meaningful Interactions | Critical | Spark real conversations |
| Shares (especially DM) | Very High | Private shares = top signal |
| Comment Quality | High | Long comments beat emoji reactions |
| Watch Time (video) | High | First 3 seconds crucial |
| Save/Bookmark | Medium | Educational content |

### What Gets Penalized

- **Engagement bait:** "Like if you agree!" = buried
- **External links in post:** Put in comments instead
- **Excessive posting:** Quality over quantity
- **Clickbait headlines:** Algorithm detects and punishes
- **Repetitive content:** Recycled posts get less reach

---

## Content Strategy

### Format Rankings (by reach)

1. **Native video** (especially short-form)
2. **Multi-image posts** with strong first image
3. **Text posts with colorful backgrounds**
4. **Links** (in comments, not main post)
5. **Single images**

### Content Pillars

| Pillar | % of Posts | Examples |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Value-First | 40% | Tips, insights, education |
| Story Posts | 25% | Transformation stories, client wins |
| Discussion Starters | 20% | Questions, polls, debates |
| Promotional | 15% | Workshop announcements, offers |

---

## Posting Best Practices

### Frequency

- **3-5 posts per week** (not daily spam)
- Quality beats quantity
- Consistent schedule matters

### Best Times to Post

- **Wednesday:** 11 AM, 1 PM
- **Thursday:** 1 PM, 2 PM
- **Friday:** 9 AM - 11 AM
- **Weekends:** Lower competition, can work well

### Post Structure

**Text Posts:**
```
[HOOK - First line that shows in preview]

[Story or context - 2-3 short paragraphs]

[Key insight or value]

[Question or CTA to spark engagement]
```

**Length Guidelines:**
- Sweet spot: 100-250 words
- Short posts (under 80 characters) get 66% more engagement
- Long-form (500+ words) works for stories

---

## Video Strategy

### Short-Form Video (Reels)

- **Under 60 seconds** performs best
- **Vertical format** (9:16)
- **Captions required** (85% watch muted)
- **Hook in first 3 seconds**
- Cross-post from TikTok (remove watermark)

### Native Video Tips

- Upload directly (don't share YouTube links)
- Square (1:1) or vertical (9:16) formats
- Add captions always
- Strong thumbnail matters

---

## Link Strategy

### The First Comment Method

External links get buried. Instead:

1. Write valuable post (no link)
2. Post it
3. Immediately add link in first comment
4. Reference: "Link in comments" or "Drop a comment and I'll send"

### Alternative: DM Engagement

- "Comment [WORD] and I'll DM you the link"
- Drives engagement + captures leads
- Personal touch builds relationships

---

## Facebook Groups Strategy

### Why Groups Matter

- Higher organic reach than Pages
- Direct access to target audience
- Community builds trust
- Less algorithmic filtering

### Group Engagement Tactics

1. Provide value before promoting
2. Answer questions thoroughly
3. Share insights without links
4. Build reputation over time
5. Only promote when appropriate

### Groups to Join

- Real estate brokerage owner groups
- Association member groups
- Real estate technology groups
- Local REALTOR association groups

---

## Post Types That Work

### 1. Value-First Posts

Educational content that helps without asking for anything.

### 2. Story Posts

Personal or client transformation stories with lessons.

### 3. Contrarian Takes

Opinions that challenge conventional wisdom (sparks debate).

### 4. Behind-the-Scenes

Humanizing content showing real work moments.

### 5. Question Posts

Simple questions that are easy to answer in comments.

### 6. Poll Posts

Binary or multiple choice questions that drive quick engagement.

---

## Hashtag Strategy

### 2025 Facebook Hashtags

- **Less important than other platforms**
- Use 2-3 maximum
- Focus on discoverability, not reach
- Put at end of post, not inline

### Recommended Hashtags

```
#realestate #realestatebroker #brokerowner #realestateai
```

---

## Engagement Strategy

### The 30-Minute Rule

- Respond to every comment within 30 minutes of posting
- Algorithm watches early engagement
- Quick replies signal active post

### Comment Quality

- Don't just say "Thanks!"
- Ask follow-up questions
- Add additional value
- Tag relevant people when appropriate

### Engagement Pods (Use Carefully)

- Coordinated engagement can help initially
- Don't make it obvious
- Real engagement always beats fake

---

## Facebook Events for Workshops

### Event Creation Tips

- Use high-quality cover image
- Clear, benefit-focused title
- Detailed description with agenda
- Set reminder notifications
- Cross-promote in Groups

### Driving Attendance

- Create urgency (limited seats)
- Share countdown posts
- Tag confirmed attendees (with permission)
- Use Event chat feature

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Posting links directly** - Use first comment instead
2. **Engagement bait** - Algorithm punishes it now
3. **Inconsistent posting** - Pick a schedule and stick to it
4. **Ignoring comments** - Reply to everything, fast
5. **Only promotional content** - 85% value, 15% promo max
6. **Sharing instead of native** - Upload directly, don't share links
7. **No video** - Video gets significantly more reach
8. **Generic content** - Specificity wins

---

## Cross-Posting Strategy

- **From TikTok:** Remove watermark, post as Reel
- **From Instagram:** Share natively (algorithm prefers)
- **From LinkedIn:** Adjust tone (more casual on Facebook)
- **Unique to Facebook:** Story posts perform well here

---

## Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| Reach | How many saw it |
| Engagement Rate | Comments + shares / reach |
| Shares | Especially private shares |
| Link Clicks | If using comment strategy |
| Video Watch Time | Retention signals quality |
