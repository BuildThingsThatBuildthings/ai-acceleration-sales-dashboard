---

## Content Strategy

4. **Native video** - 5x more engagement than text

| Educational | 15% | Quick tips, tool reviews |
| Promotional | 10% | Workshop announcements |

---

## Posting Schedule

**Frequency:** 4-5 posts per week (Mon-Fri)

**Best Times:**
- Tuesday-Thursday: 9 AM - 2 PM
- Peak windows: 10-11 AM and 12 PM (lunch)

**First 30-60 Minutes:** Critical for algorithm. Engage immediately with any comments.

---

## Post Structure

### The Hook (First 2-3 Lines)

Must stop the scroll. Options:
- Bold statement or stat
- Controversial opinion
- Intriguing question
- Story opener

**Examples:**
- "68 brokers walked into a room. All 68 said they 'use AI.'"
- "I asked 50 broker-owners one question. Only 17% had a good answer."
- "Unpopular opinion: Most AI training is useless."

### The Body

- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Use → bullets for lists
- Include specific numbers
- Tell stories, not lectures

### The CTA

- Soft: "What's been your experience?"
- Medium: "Comment [WORD] for the guide"
- Hard: "DM me 'WORKSHOP' for dates"

---

## Hashtag Strategy

**2025 Update:** Keywords now matter more than hashtags for discovery.

**Use 3-5 hashtags max:**
- #realestatebrokerage
- #brokerlife
- #realestateai
- #aitraining
- #brokerowner

Put hashtags at the end, not inline.

---

## Engagement Strategy

### Daily Tasks (15-20 min)
1. Respond to all comments on your posts
2. Comment meaningfully on 5-10 posts from target audience
3. Reply to DMs within 24 hours

### Comment Strategy
- Ask follow-up questions
- Add additional value
- Never just say "Great post!"
- Aim for 10+ word comments

---

## Employee Advocacy

**40% higher engagement** when content comes from personal profiles vs. company pages.

Strategy:
- Train team members to share and comment
- Create shareable content they can personalize
- Celebrate team engagement publicly

---

## What Makes Posts Viral

Based on analysis of top-performing B2B posts:

1. **Specific numbers** beat vague claims
2. **Personal stories** outperform corporate messaging
3. **Contrarian takes** spark debate (comments boost reach)
4. **Before/after transformations** drive saves and shares
5. **Behind-the-scenes** content humanizes the brand

---

## Common Mistakes

1. **Leading with the sell** - Give value first, always
2. **Walls of text** - Use whitespace and short paragraphs
3. **Generic advice** - Be specific to real estate
4. **No hook** - First line must stop the scroll
5. **Ignoring comments** - Reply to everything
6. **Posting and ghosting** - Engage for 30 min after posting

---

## Sample Posting Week

| Day | Content Type | Theme |
|-----|--------------|-------|
| Mon | Story post | Weekend insight or Monday motivation |
| Tue | Data/stats | Industry trend or research finding |
