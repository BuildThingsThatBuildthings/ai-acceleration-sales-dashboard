### Post 1
```
68 brokers walked into a room.
All 68 said they "use AI."

I asked one question:
"How many of you got real results?"

51 hands went down.

Here's what happened:
→ They downloaded ChatGPT
→ Typed something vague
→ Got garbage back
→ Gave up

Sound familiar?

The 17 who got results?
They got trained.
Not just one person playing around.
The whole team. Together.

That's it. That's the secret.

Comment "TRAIN" and I'll share how we do it.

### Post 2
```
I walked into a brokerage last Tuesday.

14 agents. All "using AI."

I asked: "Show me your best AI prompt."

One agent pulled up ChatGPT.
His last prompt: "write listing description"

That's it. Four words.

Then he complained AI "doesn't work."

That's like buying a Ferrari and driving it 5 mph.

The tool isn't broken.
The training is missing.

The 17% seeing real AI results?
They learned context engineering.
They built prompt libraries.
They trained as a team.

The other 83%?
Still typing "write listing description" and wondering why it sucks.

Which group is your team in?

Your agents waste 14 hours every week.

I did the math with 50 brokerages.

Writing listing descriptions: 2 hours → 10 minutes
Social media content: 3 hours → 15 minutes
Follow-up emails: 4 hours → 20 minutes
Market reports: 5 hours → 30 minutes

That's 14 hours back. Per agent. Per week.

A 20-agent office?

That's 280 hours of productivity you're losing.
Every. Single. Week.

14,560 hours per year.
That's 7 full-time employees worth of work.

And you're wondering why your agents are burned out?

Your competitor cut their marketing time by 80%.

Last month, a brokerage owner showed me their system.

→ AI writes all their listing descriptions
→ AI creates their social content
→ AI handles initial lead responses
→ AI generates market reports

Their agents spend 100% of their time on relationships and negotiations.

While you're writing emails at midnight...
They're sleeping.

While you're scrambling for social content...
They already posted.

While you're drafting market reports...
They're closing deals.

The gap is growing every day.

Every month you wait:

→ Your competitors get faster
→ Your agents get more burned out
→ Your market share erodes
→ The learning curve gets steeper

There's never been a technology shift in real estate that rewarded the slow adopters.

This won't be different.

The brokerages implementing AI today are building advantages that compound.

By the time you "find time" to figure this out...
They'll be 6 months ahead.

And that gap doesn't close.

It widens.

"We already tried AI training."

I hear this every week.

I always ask: "Who did it? How's adoption been?"

90% of the time:
→ It was a webinar
→ One person watched it
→ Nobody uses it 30 days later

That's not training.
That's entertainment.

Real training:
→ Hands-on implementation
→ Everyone together
→ Custom to your workflows
→ Built during the session

The difference between watching a cooking show and learning to cook.

You can't learn to swim by watching videos.
You can't master AI by attending webinars.

The AI Paradox in Real Estate:

68% of agents have adopted AI.
Only 17% report significant positive impact.

Let that sink in.

More than half who try AI fail to see results.

Why?

1. Solo experimentation (one person playing, not team adoption)
2. Wrong expectations (magic button vs. learned skill)
3. Poor prompts (garbage in, garbage out)
4. No measurement (can't improve what you don't track)
5. No system (random experiments vs. integrated workflows)

The 17% who win do the opposite of all five.

Which side of this paradox is your brokerage on?

I asked a broker-owner how much time her agents spend on email.

"I don't know. A lot?"

We measured it.

4.5 hours per day. Per agent.

That's 22.5 hours per week on email.
56% of their working hours.

On email.

Not selling. Not negotiating. Not building relationships.

Email.

AI can draft 80% of those emails in seconds.
Not replace the human touch.
Handle the routine so agents can focus on what matters.

How much of your agents' time is email eating?

The math that should scare every broker:

Average agent hourly value: $50
Hours wasted on AI-automatable tasks: 14/week
Weekly loss per agent: $700
Monthly loss per agent: $2,800
Annual loss per agent: $33,600

10 agents = $336,000 in lost productivity per year.
20 agents = $672,000.

You're bleeding it.

"My agents are independent contractors. I can't force them."

I hear this weekly.

Here's what successful broker-owners do:

→ Make training "optional" but strongly encouraged
→ Schedule it during a required meeting slot
→ Show the time savings math
→ Let early adopters become internal champions
→ Create FOMO by celebrating AI wins publicly

You're right - you can't force them.

But you can make NOT learning feel like a disadvantage.

The agents who want to grow will show up.
Those are the ones you want anyway.

Every brokerage has that one agent.

The one who's "not tech-savvy."
The one who "doesn't do computers."
The one everyone assumes will never use AI.

In 90% of my workshops, that agent has the biggest breakthrough.

Why?

They have no bad habits to unlearn.
They follow instructions exactly.
They're not trying to be clever.

Your "tech-resistant" agents aren't the problem.
Your assumptions about them are.

Give everyone the chance.
You'll be surprised who excels.

### Post 12

I asked a managing broker what happens when a listing comes in.

"The agent writes the description, creates the flyer, posts to social, drafts the emails..."

"How long does that take?"

"Oh, probably 3-4 hours total."

3-4 hours of repeatable work.
For every single listing.

Same basic elements every time.
Different details, same structure.

This is exactly what AI excels at.

Not eliminating the agent.
Eliminating the redundant 3-4 hours.

So agents can spend that time getting MORE listings.

"We don't have budget for training right now."

I love this objection.

Here's the math:

Training cost: $5,000
Time saved per agent per week: 5 hours
Your agents: 20
Hourly value of agent time: $50

Weekly value recovered: 20 × 5 × $50 = $5,000

The training pays for itself in WEEK ONE.

After that? Pure profit.

Month 1: $15,000 recovered
Year 1: $260,000 recovered

You can't afford NOT to train.

The #1 complaint I hear from broker-owners:

"My agents won't use new tools."

But here's what I've noticed:

Those same agents:
→ Adopted smartphones immediately
→ Learned Zillow and Redfin
→ Use Instagram daily
→ Navigate complex CRMs

They're not anti-technology.
They're anti-useless-training.

Show them something that saves them TIME (not adds tasks).
Train them TOGETHER (not solo webinars).
Make it HANDS-ON (not theoretical).

Suddenly "resistance" disappears.

It was never about the tech.
It was about the approach.

A listing description used to take my agents 40 minutes.

Now it takes 10.

Not because AI writes it for them.
Because AI writes the first draft.
Then the agent adds their expertise.

AI handles the structure, features, neighborhood details.
Agent adds the soul, the story, the emotion.

Best of both worlds:
→ Consistency in format
→ Time savings on basics
→ Human touch where it matters

This is how AI works in practice.
Not replacement.
Enhancement.

### Post 16

I watched a broker-owner create a week of social content in 10 minutes yesterday.

Here's exactly what she did:

1. Opened ChatGPT
2. Pasted her "content persona" prompt (took 30 seconds)
3. Typed: "Give me 7 post ideas about [topic]"
4. Picked 5 she liked
5. Typed: "Write posts for ideas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5"
6. Light editing (2 minutes)
7. Scheduled in Buffer

Done. 10 minutes. Week of content.

This used to take her 3 hours.
Same quality. Less time.

And she taught her entire team to do the same.

The worst advice I hear about AI:

"Just play around with it."

Playing around produces:
→ Random results
→ No consistency
→ Wasted time
→ Frustration
→ Giving up

Structured learning produces:
→ Repeatable workflows
→ Prompt libraries
→ Team-wide adoption
→ Measurable time savings
→ Compounding benefits

You wouldn't tell a new agent to "just play around" with contracts.

Why would you approach AI that way?

Every broker has these two types of agents:

Type 1:
Works until midnight
Does everything manually
"Doesn't have time" for training
Always behind on marketing
Burned out

Type 2:
Leaves at 5pm
Uses AI for routine tasks
Made time for training
Marketing runs on autopilot
Energized

Same market.
Same opportunity.
Different approach.

NAR Technology Survey 2025:

68% of agents have adopted AI.
17% report significant positive impact.

That's a 51% failure rate.

The technology isn't the problem.
The implementation is.

The winners:
→ Trained their entire team
→ Built systems, not experiments
→ Measured results
→ Iterated and improved

The losers:
→ One person "played with it"
→ Used generic prompts
→ Expected magic
→ Gave up after 2 weeks

I analyzed 50 brokerages last month.

Here's what I found:

Average time spent on tasks AI can handle:
→ Listing descriptions: 40 min → 10 min possible
→ Social media: 3 hrs/week → 15 min possible
→ Follow-up emails: 4 hrs/day → 20 min possible
→ Market reports: 5 hrs/month → 30 min possible

Total potential time savings: 14+ hours per agent per week.

Only 17% are capturing these savings.

The rest are still doing everything manually.

$503,000,000

That's how much was stolen via wire fraud in real estate in 2023.
$72,000 average per incident.

One of AI's most underrated uses?

→ Email analysis for fraud detection
→ Pattern recognition on suspicious requests
→ Automated verification workflows
→ 24/7 monitoring of communications

Your team's time savings are important.

But so is protecting them (and your clients) from fraud.

AI does both.

LinkedIn generates 277% more B2B leads than Facebook and Twitter combined.

Why most brokerages ignore it:
→ "Our clients are on Facebook"
→ "LinkedIn is for job seekers"
→ "We don't have time"

Why smart brokerages prioritize it:
→ Decision-makers are here
→ Referral partners are here
→ Your reputation builds here
→ High-ticket relationships start here

You're not selling houses on LinkedIn.
You're building the authority that attracts listings.

Only 5% of firms have achieved their AI objectives.

Commercial is ahead of residential in adoption.
But both sectors have the same problem:

Adoption ≠ Results

The 5% who succeed:
→ Executive sponsorship
→ Clear metrics
→ Team-wide training
→ Measured ROI

The 95% who struggle:
→ Grassroots experiments
→ No clear goals
→ Individual tinkerers
→ No tracking

75% of buyers are influenced by thought leadership content.
52% of decision-makers spend 1+ hours per week reading it.

But most brokerages post:
→ Just sold photos
→ New listing alerts
→ Generic market updates

Nothing wrong with those.
But they don't build authority.

→ Industry insights with your perspective
→ Data analysis with your take
→ Problems you've solved
→ Lessons you've learned

Video content gets 403% more inquiries on real estate listings.

Yet most brokerages:

→ Write text-only updates
→ Ignore video entirely

The excuse: "We don't have time."

AI solution:
→ Script written in 2 minutes
→ Talking points generated
→ Captions created automatically
→ Repurposing suggestions included

Video isn't optional anymore.

Months to recruit replacement: 3-6

Cost of vacancy: $11,250 - $22,500 per empty desk

The difference between AI and human work in real estate:

AI handles:
→ First drafts
→ Structure and format
→ Repetitive tasks
→ Data analysis
→ Speed

Humans handle:
→ Relationships
→ Negotiations
→ Final judgment
→ Emotional intelligence
→ Trust building

AI writes the listing description draft.
You add the story only you know.

AI analyzes the comp data.
You explain what it means for THIS seller.

AI prepares the follow-up sequence.
You make the call that closes the deal.

Not either/or.
Both/and.

Wrong: AI will replace agents.
Right: AI will replace agents who don't use AI.

Wrong: AI is complicated.
Right: AI is simpler than your CRM.

Wrong: AI content is cold and generic.
Right: AI with good prompts is warm and specific.

Wrong: AI takes time to learn.
Right: 6 hours of training lasts forever.

Wrong: AI is for young, tech-savvy agents.
Right: AI helps everyone equally.

The misconceptions are holding you back more than the technology.

How to get your team excited about AI training:

1. Show the math
Not "AI is cool" but "AI saves 5 hours/week = $250/week = $13,000/year per agent."

2. Let skeptics voice concerns
"What worries you about AI?" Then address each one.

3. Start with their pain
"What task do you hate most?" Then show AI solving it.

4. Use peer pressure positively
"[Top agent] has been using this for a month. Ask her about it."

5. Make it hands-on immediately
No lectures. Building from minute one.

Excitement comes from seeing results.
Not from hype.

The AI learning curve for real estate:

Day 1: "This seems complicated."
Day 2: "Oh, it's just talking to it like a person."
Day 3: "Wait, it can do THAT?"
Day 7: "I can't believe I did this manually before."
Day 30: "I can't imagine working without it."
Day 90: "I'm training other agents now."

The curve is steep at first.
Then it levels off fast.
Then it becomes indispensable.

Most people quit at Day 2.
Winners push through to Day 7.

Free resources that teach AI for real estate:

→ ChatGPT's built-in help docs
→ YouTube: Search "ChatGPT for real estate"
→ NAR's tech resources (nar.realtor)
→ This LinkedIn profile (shameless plug)

But here's the truth:

Free resources teach you about AI.
Hands-on training teaches you to use AI.

Big difference.

You can watch 100 cooking videos.
Or you can cook one meal with a chef.

Both have value.
Only one creates skill.

The prompt formula that works for everything:

"You are a [ROLE].
Write a [FORMAT] for [AUDIENCE].
About [TOPIC].
In [TONE] voice.
Include [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS].
Keep it under [LENGTH]."

Example:

"You are a luxury real estate marketer.
Write a social media post for first-time buyers.
About the importance of pre-approval.
In friendly, encouraging voice.
Include a statistic and a call to action.
Keep it under 150 words."

That's it. Use it everywhere.

## Old School Wisdom Posts (5 posts)

### Post 61

My grandfather sold real estate in 1962.

No internet. No MLS database.
Just a Rolodex and a handshake.

He taught me something about this business:

"The deal doesn't close in the paperwork.
It closes in the conversation before."

Know what the best agents in 2025 understand?

The same thing.

AI handles the paperwork faster.
AI writes the listings in minutes.
AI manages the follow-ups automatically.

But the conversation?
The relationship?
The trust?

That's still you.

The best agents in 1962 followed up.
The best agents in 2025 follow up.

The difference? AI handles the timing.
You handle the conversation.

Unpopular opinion:

AI doesn't make good agents.

Good agents make AI useful.

I've seen top producers who can't spell "ChatGPT."
I've seen tech-obsessed agents who can't close.

The fundamentals never changed:
→ Know your market
→ Listen more than you talk
→ Follow up relentlessly
→ Keep your word
→ Be where you say you'll be

AI just makes those fundamentals faster.

If you couldn't close before AI, you won't close after.
If you could close before AI, you'll close more now.

The tool amplifies what's already there.

Make sure there's something worth amplifying.

A 30-year broker told me something last week.

"I've watched fax machines come and go.
I've watched the internet scare everyone.
I've watched social media become mandatory.

Every new technology has the same pattern:
→ Early adopters get ahead
→ Resisters fall behind
→ But the ones who win?

They're the ones who kept the fundamentals
while adding the new tools."

She's right.

The best agents I know use AI for the admin work.
So they have MORE time for the human work.

AI doesn't replace judgment.
AI protects the time needed to exercise it.

Your instincts? Still yours.
Your relationships? Still yours.
Your reputation? Still yours.

AI just gives you more time to invest in them.

What fundamentals do you refuse to compromise on?

#experiencematters #realestatebrokerage #oldschoolwisdom
```

### Post 64
```
In 1985, the top agents:
→ Returned calls the same day
→ Knew their neighborhoods cold
→ Showed up when they said they would
→ Remembered the details

In 2025, the top agents:
→ Return calls the same day
→ Know their neighborhoods cold
→ Show up when they said they would
→ Remember the details

The difference?

AI helps them return MORE calls.
AI helps them know MORE neighborhoods.
AI helps them show up PREPARED.
AI helps them remember EVERY detail.

The principles never changed.
The capacity did.

Old school heart.
Modern tools.
That's the winning combination.

Hot take: Most AI training misses the point.

They teach the technology.
They forget the purpose.

Here's what I mean:

AI can write 100 follow-up emails in 10 minutes.

But if you don't understand WHY follow-up matters...
If you don't know WHEN the personal touch beats automation...
If you can't read the room on WHICH clients need a call instead...

Then you're just sending more spam faster.

The best agents know:
→ When to let AI handle it
→ When to pick up the phone
→ When to show up in person

AI handles the speed.
Your judgment handles the wisdom.

Technology changes. Human nature doesn't.

Your grandmother knew when to send a handwritten note.
You should know when to send a personal text.

Same instinct. Different tool.
