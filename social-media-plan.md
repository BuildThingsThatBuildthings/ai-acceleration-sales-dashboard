## Part 3: Video Prompts & Scripts

### Short-Form Video Scripts (TikTok/Reels/Shorts)

#### Script 1: The AI Reality Check (30 seconds)
**Hook Type:** Controversy/Bold Statement
```
[HOOK - Text on screen + voiceover]
"68% of agents say they're using AI... but only 17% are actually seeing results."

[CONTENT]
"Here's what's happening:
Most brokers download ChatGPT, ask it to write one listing description,
get a generic response, and give up.

That's like buying a Ferrari and only driving it to the mailbox.

[CTA]
The difference between the 17% winning and everyone else?
They got trained. Link in bio for the free AI audit."
```

#### Script 2: The Time Waste Calculator (45 seconds)
**Hook Type:** Data/Statistics
```
[HOOK - Text on screen]
"Your agents waste 14 hours per week on tasks AI can do in minutes."

[CONTENT]
"I did the math with 50 brokerages last month.

Writing listing descriptions: 2 hours → 10 minutes
Social media content: 3 hours → 15 minutes
Follow-up emails: 4 hours → 20 minutes
Market reports: 5 hours → 30 minutes

That's 14 hours back. Per agent. Per week.

A 20-agent office? That's 280 hours of productivity you're losing every single week."

[CTA - Text on screen]
"Free AI Assessment → Link in bio"
```

#### Script 3: The Competitor Fear (30 seconds)
**Hook Type:** FOMO/Urgency
```
[HOOK]
"Your competitor just cut their marketing time by 80%. Here's how."

[CONTENT]
"Last month, a brokerage owner showed me their system.
- AI writes all their listing descriptions
- AI creates their social content
- AI handles their initial lead responses
- AI generates their market reports

Their agents now spend 100% of their time on what actually closes deals:
relationships and negotiations.

While you're writing emails at midnight, they're sleeping."

[CTA]
"Workshop dates for [CITY] are live. 12 spots left."
```

#### Script 4: The Myth Buster (45 seconds)
**Hook Type:** Contrarian/Myth-Busting
```
[HOOK - Look directly at camera]
"AI is going to replace real estate agents... is what people who don't
understand real estate keep saying."

[CONTENT]
"Here's the truth:
AI cannot build trust at a kitchen table.
AI cannot negotiate a tough seller down.
AI cannot hold a first-time buyer's hand at closing.

But AI CAN:
- Write your listing descriptions
- Create your marketing
- Handle your follow-ups
- Analyze your market

AI won't replace agents. But agents using AI will absolutely replace
agents who don't."

[CTA]
"Stop falling behind. Link in bio."
```

#### Script 5: The Quick Win Demo (60 seconds)
**Hook Type:** Tutorial/How-To
```
[HOOK - Screen recording starting]
"I'm about to save you 2 hours on your next listing. Watch this."

[CONTENT - Screen share]
"Open ChatGPT. Copy this exact prompt:

'You are a luxury real estate copywriter. Write a listing description
for: [paste your MLS notes]. Make it emotional, highlight the lifestyle,
and include a compelling opening hook. 150 words max.'

Paste your notes. Hit enter.

[Show results]

20 seconds. Done.

Now imagine your whole team doing this for every listing, every email,
every social post."

[CTA]
"Want 47 more prompts like this? Free download in bio."

### Long-Form Video Scripts (YouTube/Webinars)

#### Script 6: The State of AI in Real Estate 2025 (10-12 minutes)
```
INTRO (0:00-0:45)
"If you're running a real estate brokerage in 2025 and you haven't
implemented AI yet, this video is going to be uncomfortable. Because
your competitors are watching this right now, and they're taking action.

I'm [Name], and I've trained over 200 brokerages on AI implementation.
Today I'm sharing the exact data on where the industry is heading."

SECTION 1: THE DATA (0:45-3:00)
[Share screen with statistics]
"Let's look at the numbers:
- 75% of top brokerages are using AI technology
- The market is growing from $226B in 2024 to $731B by 2028
- BUT - and this is the problem - only 5% of firms have achieved
  their AI objectives

Why the gap? Implementation. Training. Strategy."

SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM (3:00-5:30)
"Here's what I see when I walk into most brokerages:
1. They downloaded ChatGPT
2. They tried it once for a listing description
3. Got a generic result
4. Gave up and said 'AI doesn't work for real estate'

That's like buying a professional camera, taking one blurry photo,
and concluding photography doesn't work.

The tool isn't the problem. The training is."

SECTION 3: WHAT TOP PERFORMERS DO DIFFERENTLY (5:30-8:00)
"The 17% seeing real results from AI do three things:
1. They trained their entire team - not just one person playing with it
2. They created systems and workflows - not random experiments
3. They measured time savings and conversion improvements

One brokerage I worked with went from 2 hours per listing description
to 10 minutes. That's not incremental improvement. That's transformation."

SECTION 4: THE RISK OF WAITING (8:00-10:00)
"Every month you wait:
- Your competitors get faster
- Your agents get frustrated
- Your market share erodes
- The learning curve for your team gets steeper

There's never been a technology shift in real estate that rewarded
the slow adopters. This won't be different."

CTA (10:00-12:00)
"Here's what I'm offering:
A free 30-minute AI audit for your brokerage. I'll analyze your
current operations and show you exactly where AI can save you
10+ hours per week.

No pitch. No pressure. Just clarity.

Book your audit at [link]. If you got value from this video,
subscribe and share it with another broker who needs to hear this."

## Part 4: Post Templates by Platform

### LinkedIn Post Templates

#### Template 1: Data-Driven Authority Post
```
I analyzed [NUMBER] brokerages last month.

Here's what I found:

The average brokerage wastes [NUMBER] hours per week on tasks
AI can do in minutes.

→ Listing descriptions: X hours → X minutes
→ Social content: X hours → X minutes
→ Lead follow-up: X hours → X minutes
→ Market reports: X hours → X minutes

The brokerages winning right now aren't working harder.
They're working smarter.

Question for broker-owners:
How many hours are YOUR agents wasting each week?

💬 Comment "AUDIT" and I'll send you our free assessment
```

#### Template 2: Contrarian Take
```
Unpopular opinion about AI in real estate:

Most brokers are implementing it wrong.

They buy the tools.
Download the apps.
Maybe try it once.

Then wonder why nothing changes.

Here's what actually works:

1. Start with the biggest time-wasters
2. Train the ENTIRE team (not just one person)
3. Create systems, not experiments
4. Measure time saved, not just "cool factor"

AI isn't magic.
It's a multiplier.

And you can't multiply zero.

#### Template 3: Story-Based Post
```
Last month I got a call from a broker-owner in [CITY].

"Ryan, I'm drowning. My agents are burning out. We can't
keep up with the marketing. I'm working 14-hour days
and falling behind."

I asked one question:
"How much of your day is spent on repetitive tasks?"

His answer: "Probably 60%."

We spent 6 hours together.

Now his agents create a week's content in 10 minutes.
His lead follow-up runs on autopilot.
His market reports generate themselves.

He texted me last week:
"I actually made it to my daughter's soccer game on Tuesday."

That's what this is really about.

Only 17% report significant positive impact.

That means 51% downloaded an app, tried it once, and gave up.

Here's why:
❌ No training on effective prompts
❌ No system for integrating it into workflows
❌ No measurement of actual time saved
❌ Tried it alone instead of as a team

The 17% who are winning? They got trained.
